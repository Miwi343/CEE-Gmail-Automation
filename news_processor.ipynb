Migration More than 55,000 Chinese migrants have illegally entered the U.S. through Mexico over the past year and a half, “the largest wave of illegal border crossings by Chinese immigrants in history — part of a wider influx that is also bringing record numbers of migrants from South America, India, Turkey and an array of African nations,” reports the Washington Post [ https://substack.com/redirect/8bb99e90-b791-4cf6-bcec-7d64451ca810?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. A mass exodus from Chiapas to Guatemala last week — more than 500 Mexicans fled their homes, emptying entire communities — is a response to violence linked to territorial conflict between drug cartels. “But the conflict between these groups has also taken in and inflamed existing tensions in a region with a history of violence over access to land,” reports the Guardian [ https://substack.com/redirect/4acbec6c-f902-4f06-8ff9-99edb28c8c39?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ].

Mexico Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García was not tricked into traveling to Texas, last week, rather he was abducted by Joaquín Guzmán López, a younger Sinaloa Cartel leader, who “with a group of henchmen who handcuffed him, stuck a bag over his head and muscled him into a car and then on to the plane, where he remained bound throughout the flight,” reports the New York Times [ https://substack.com/redirect/38716598-4515-448b-9491-387d1113e897?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ].

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://boz.substack.com/p/venezuela-post-election-scenario Yesterday, the Venezuelan opposition announced it has possession of 73% of the actas showing the vote totals for locations around the country. The totals (rounded) are 6.3 million votes for Edmundo Gonzalez and 2.8 million for Nicolas Maduro. The opposition won in every state. They won in precincts that previously voted heavily in favor of the Chavistas. It is a mathematical impossibility for Maduro to have won the election given that data. The opposition will post all its evidence online to be reviewed by international observers, who should be able to confirm that Gonzalez won. The CNE is obligated to post the same data for 100% of the voting precincts, but they haven't done so because they are complicit in covering up Maduro's loss. The CNE announced Maduro is the winner of the election by a completely made up 51-44 number. Maduro appears to have the support of the top civilian and military leadership. There are still layers of repressive forces around him. The main questions I've received in the past 24 hours are \"does Maduro leave?\" and \"how does Maduro leave?\" Similar to my pre-election scenarios (I posted a summary here [ https://substack.com/redirect/2b76390a-0392-442a-ba1e-3029bba7ef9e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]; some clients have a longer memo), you can divide the potential scenarios into three buckets that aren't completely mutually exclusive, but close enough for this exercise. There are plenty of sub-scenarios underneath each bucket, some better than others. Status quo: Maduro holds on to power Change: Someone else takes over the presidency Chaos: Control is contested for months to come 0. Status quo remains a likely outcome. Maduro has the tools of repression. He has survived previous waves of protests, controversial elections, and attempts to oust his government. From a prediction model standpoint, call it the tyranny of base rates of tyranny. Consolidated dictatorships survive everything until they reach a peak moment of crisis or a very specific set of circumstances (usually involving security forces suddenly turning against them). So prediction models rarely tip to >50% likely to fall in the next 12 months because the past precedent is that they survive more often than they crash. Usually, there are only a few days or weeks of warning before the transition comes. But dictatorships do crash sometimes, even when the odds are against that happening. And some indicators are flashing red in Venezuela including the mass protests that hit the streets yesterday. Part of the reason I'm writing this memo today is that I'm working through the question whether Maduro will stay or go. Scenarios for change So let's talk about the scenarios everyone wants to hear about in which change comes to the country. How does change come to Venezuela? What indicators would show that change is more likely? There are five basic scenarios in which Maduro loses power in the next six months, in order of most to least likely: 1. Maduro accepts defeat in the election. If change does surprisingly come in Venezuela in the coming months, it's most likely from this scenario. The immediate criticism of this scenario is \"But he already claimed victory!?!?!\" Yes, but he can change his mind. Pressure from protests and the international community can force Maduro to admit that the CNE recount shows he actually lost the election. At that point, a negotiation takes place that likely grants him amnesty, gives the military some promises of stability, and gives the Chavistas some sort of power-sharing arrangement. Maduro goes for an extended beach vacation in Cuba. The reason this is the most likely change scenario is that it is a semi-dignified exit that protects the interests of those in power and those in the region. This scenario is almost exactly the same as the unlikely but possible scenarios discussed before the election in which Maduro accepts the loss (the same way authoritarians lost elections in Nicaragua, Chile, and Honduras), just a week or two later than scheduled. It's the change scenario that Venezuela's neighbors would like to see, vs the other four scenarios below are the ones they want to avoid. One thing standing in this scenario's way is that the Chavistas have lost some leverage with the mass vote against them and the protests. They would have been better off negotiating three months ago, but hubris led them to a massive election defeat and then an attempt to hold on while tens of thousands took the streets. They won't get as much in a transition negotiation now as they would have gotten before. To be clear: This is the scenario we should all want to happen! This is the scenario I want to happen. Everyone in the international community right now should be pushing for Maduro to change his mind and accept electoral defeat and a transition. That would be the most stable outcome for Venezuela and the one that leads to improving the country in the coming years. The pressure should be on the Chavista civilian and military leadership around Maduro to convince them that this is the correct next step. As ugly as it is and even if he doesn't deserve it, the international community and Maduro's domestic opponents should be willing to offer lots of incentives for him to leave. 2. Military coup. Security force defection is the top way dictators leave power globally. There are two ways this military coup happens. First, Vladimir Padrino Lopez says, \"time is up\" and leads a unified group of military commanders to toss out Maduro. At that point, Padrino begins talking with other actors to figure out who the next civilian president is and that person gets to be civilian president as long as they promise to not turn on the military commanders who committed the coup. This seems unlikely at the moment as Venezuela's minister of defense has said he respects Maduro's electoral victory, but like Maduro, he can change his mind. Second, if the top generals refuse to flip, several units led by a lower ranking officer make the attempt. The DGCIM (Cuba-backed military counter-intelligence) exists to prevent this second coup scenario. They make it very hard for lower level units to coordinate a rebellion and shut down whispers of coups very early. But if enough units defected at the same time, the coordination could come about organically. One warning: military coups usually don't lead to democratic governments. They usually lead to more military coups and dictatorships. The theory that the military steps in, forces Maduro out, then hands the leadership to Edmundo Gonzalez and steps back from politics as a democratic transition consolidates is an idealized world that rarely occurs. That's why a coup is less ideal than Maduro accepting defeat. It spills over into the chaos scenarios. 3. Protests plus security force indifference. Whether coordinated from the top or not, if the security forces stop repressing protesters, the protesters can take over government installations and toss out Maduro and his allies. There are layers of repression managed by multiple institutions (as Javier Corrales explained on Twitter yesterday [ https://substack.com/redirect/f10f722c-0210-4a69-b467-d050319e3b9f?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]). In yesterday's protests, colectivos and plain-clothed police officers were the ones firing bullets into the crowds of protesters, giving them some level of impunity from prosecution. Similar to the lower level military coup scenario, the DGCIM and other institutions prevent security forces from coordinating their actions, making it very dangerous for any single unit to refuse to repress protesters. The military isn’t the main actor in this effort and cannot control the repression from the top down. Globally, protests against dictatorships used to work but haven't succeeded after Arab Spring. Dictatorships have gotten their repressive mechanisms in order. Nicaragua, where Ortega and his security forces killed protesters until they were forced to give up, is a brutal case in point for the region. It would be great for Venezuela to be a rare counter-example of protests succeeding at tossing out a dictator, but not something I would bet on. 4. Assassination or Accident. While a systemic military coup is the bigger threat, Maduro needs to be concerned about rogue officers or even civilians who can get close to him. Once again, there are plenty of security forces in place to attempt to prevent this scenario. While I'm sure some people would cheer, it's a bad scenario for any transition as it leaves a power vacuum and potentially encourages retaliatory violence down the line. 5. International intervention. Nobody is advocating for this at the moment. The only two ways this occurs are 1) Maduro crosses an international border and tries to invade a neighboring country (I wrote about why that is unlikely [ https://substack.com/redirect/a439212c-8115-41c3-8d2e-7354e2cad10e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] late last year) or 2) Maduro commits an abuse so horrific that the international community is forced to step in under a responsibility to protect framework. Neither of these scenarios seems possible at the moment and I think Maduro understands the red lines he needs to respect to avoid this scenario. What about the chaos scenarios? I’m not dealing with this category today other than to say many of the change scenarios I outlined above would have fallen into my pre-election memo's chaos scenarios. I've moved the bar on these definitions post-election. There remain some concerning scenarios involving long term civil conflict, but I'm more focused today on the immediate question of whether the Maduro regime stays or goes. What should happen in the coming days? At the top of this newsletter, I noted that the opposition has the evidence to prove they won the election. This is where the international community's focus should be for the next few days. Demand the CNE release the vote totals. But as the CNE refuses to do so, count the vote receipts the opposition is holding as evidence. The receipts demonstrating with mathematical certainty that Maduro lost the election are a big hit to his legitimacy, well beyond the more complicated (but accurate!) claims of past stolen elections. Pause to appreciate the irony that the electoral system put in place by Hugo Chavez included a verification mechanism to prevent stolen elections and that verification mechanism (the printed actas at each voting site) is now functioning to prove that Chavez's successor stole an election. There are going to be protests and those protests will face violent repression. On top of demanding election results, the international community must inform Maduro that it is watching the repression and send messages that they are monitoring specific actors. Perpetrators and authors of violence will be held responsible. Convincing any sector of the security forces to stop repression or to reconsider their loyalty can help Maduro realize that his best exit is one he negotiates rather than one that is forced upon him at gunpoint. So what’s the prediction? I don’t have a new specific public prediction right this moment. I made my public prediction pre-election [ https://substack.com/redirect/2b76390a-0392-442a-ba1e-3029bba7ef9e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] with the information I had at that moment and I think it was a good one and not yet resolved. The situation is fluid enough right now that any updated prediction I write in the newsletter might be out of date by the end of the day. Even if the prediction models say Maduro is favored to hold on, oppositions win by fighting against the odds. Their bravery is humbling and their execution of a strategy to get this far has been impressive. To the extent I can advocate for change, I will. I’m not an unbiased analyst. I’m happy to say I’m biased on the issue of hoping for and working towards a democratic Venezuela. For those in Venezuela who have helped inform my knowledge of events in recent days and my analysis of these scenarios, stay safe.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://www.piratewireservices.com/p/venezuela-from-hope-to-heartbreak For tens of millions of Venezuelans, Sunday started out as a day of hope— and celebration. Despite widespread fear —and sometimes fatalistic certainty— that Maduro would not respect the results of a referendum on his decade-long rule, many both within the country and without, reveled over the strongest challenge to Maduro since he assumed the presidency [ https://substack.com/redirect/d3b7b8f7-2bf4-4d8f-8b32-b710c21a2adf?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. From Caracas to Madrid, to Bogotá, even in Canada and Australia, the 8-million-strong Venezuela diaspora celebrated elections in the streets in dozens of world capitals— despite the fact that the vast majority of them had been disenfranchised from the voting process by their birth country. But as the day progressed, festivity transformed into tension as irregularities plagued election processes. Long lines, especially in areas where the opposition tends to do well, forced some voters to wait 4 to 5 hours to cast their votes. Some voting centers never opened at all. By the afternoon, some lost their patience, quarreling with election officials and security forces alike over suspicions that the delays were intentional. When polls closed at 6 p.m., many Venezuelans were still waiting to vote. Turnout, according to opposition election observers, was the highest it has been in years. Meanwhile, the country’s election body, the National Election Council, (CNE), controlled by Maduro’s party, and which usually provides updates on voter-turnout and begins releasing counts, suddenly went silent. That silence continued for 4 hours. Anchors at state media companies filled the information with meaningless banter, and at least one station simply gave up and switched over to showing a movie from the United States instead. Just after 10 p.m., Maduro appeared on national T.V. “The results of the election are irreversible,” he said, and promptly declared victory with 51% of the vote, although CNE had still not released any voting data. He blamed the delay on a \"terrorist attack\" on Venezuelan election systems from abroad, called on the people to \"respect the results of the election\", and \"celebrate this triumph of the Bolivarian revolution. He offered no details or proof about the alleged terrorist attack. Opposition supporters immediately accused the government of fraud and demanded all data be released. But the CNE website, where that data is usually published, went dark [ https://substack.com/redirect/078c11ce-afd3-4885-9e16-abbb5c529db9?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] (and as of this article being published is still not working). Karen Rojas, 26, a Venezuelan living in Medellin, openly wept at an election results party attended by PWS. “The worst part is I allowed myself to hope against my better judgment,” she said. “I should have known nothing would change.” She worried her brother, still in Táchira, Venezuela, would end up hurt. “Protests will start tomorrow,” she said. “I’ve lived through that before. I’ve seen what police do.” Pirate Wire Services is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support our work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. “He is a hothead”, she said. “I’m worried he will get himself killed.” Her prediction about protests was spot-on. In the morning, cacerolazos, Latin American pot-banging protests, echoed across the country. By the afternoon, police and protesters were openly clashing. Venezuelan journalist Titi González posted a video [ http://video of a panoramic view of western Caracas —once a stronghold of Chavismo— full of smoke from the spontaneous protests and subsequent clashes. It looked like a warzone. ] of a panoramic view of western Caracas —once a stronghold of Chavismo— full of smoke from the spontaneous protests and subsequent clashes. It looked like a warzone. By late afternoon, protesters had surrounded Miraflores, where the presidential palace is located in Caracas, where the openly clashed with police. The government of Mauro found itself staring down something it has never faced before, a real revolution of the barrios. In the past, the response of security forces to social unrest has been absolutely brutal. Between 2015 and 2017, Venezuelan security forces killed 19,000 people [ https://substack.com/redirect/99ebbaed-cdfa-41cb-9aad-81d6ec4fdb1c?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] for “resisting arrest” according to Human Rights Watch. Venezuela has a population of 28 million people. For comparison, in the United States, which has a population of over 300 million, police killed just over 1,000 people in 2023. At 6 p.m. on Monday, as protests raged on, opposition leader María Corina Machado gave a press conference in which she claimed to have proof of election fraud [ https://substack.com/redirect/a211d0ac-a66c-49da-83cb-3e19dd2e7744?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. With 73% of votes counted, she said, the results showed that opposition presidential candidate González Urrutia was the true victor of Sunday’s elections. By nightfall, multiple reports of colectivos (social groups set up by Hugo Chávez which also sometimes serve as militia enforcers of the government) attacking protesters flooded social media. Protesters had also blocked major highways as well as the airport in Caracas. In just 24 hours, the country had gone from hope to heartbreak, to active resistance on the streets against a security apparatus well-known for its brutality. What comes next is anyone’s guess. As we write these words, Venezuela’s future is uncertain. A major and violent crackdown is a distinct possibility. We at PWS very much hope that dark prediction doesn’t come to fruition. But we also fear that it very well may.

The main opposition candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia received 44.2 percent, with 80 percent of voting stations counted. The results set Maduro up for a third presidential term, that would last until 2031. There were widespread reports of irregularities and voter intimidation throughout the day yesterday. Opposition leaders said their monitors were kicked out of polling stations and denounced irregularities with vote tallies.

(Associated Press [ https://substack.com/redirect/f5e56e7f-5fa3-4727-9c39-09036071d168?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Opposition parties immediately challenged the results, saying the contradicted data they had received earlier in the day from the electoral agency, before it halted information sharing abruptly, which showed Gonzalez with 70 percent of the vote compared to 30 percent for Maduro.

She said the electoral authority announcement is not credible given these earlier results, and also cited exit polls from reputable firms that contradict the electoral authority announcement. (Efecto Cocuyo [ https://substack.com/redirect/1fc8c226-e778-4269-b3eb-cf028de83208?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], Runrun.es [ https://substack.com/redirect/d812a4e0-b138-4519-b816-f01e8aa08c2f?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/ff2cab34-aa0a-4052-bdba-656aed29acbf?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Opposition leaders say electoral officials’ refusal to release paper tallies of the electronic vote in many polling places. Venezuelan electoral law guarantees access to the paper printout of each electronic voting machine’s final tally. But so far opposition monitors have only obtained 40 percent of these tallies. Without these paper counts, the results cannot be verified. (New York Times [ https://substack.com/redirect/e7d45ca2-017b-477d-ad53-6fb957bc20d9?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] and New York Times [ https://substack.com/redirect/649afe0f-9122-4d0d-8206-308228b71c44?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Machado asked election observers and supporters to remain at voting centers until all voting records arrive.

He said he was not calling people out onto the streets. (Efecto Cocuyo [ https://substack.com/redirect/594534e3-a06f-4617-ba14-23c5e574ccd8?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], Associated Press [ https://substack.com/redirect/f5e56e7f-5fa3-4727-9c39-09036071d168?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Though it was always considered unlikely that the Maduro government would simply cede power, Venezuelans expressed a strong desire for change during the campaign, which fanned optimistic expectations that Venezuela’s fractious opposition, which had mustered a united front against a Chavista government, could successfully force a democratic transition via ballot boxes. Citizens were motived after years of political apathy, and Venezuela’s election day effectively started the night before polls opened in many places, as people camped in line to vote. The government sought to quash the swell of opposition support by suppressing voters, organizing polling stations to ensure long lines, moving polling places at the last minute, limiting voting hours, and, in other cases, extending voting times in areas where officials rounded up pro-government votes. The Washington Post [ https://substack.com/redirect/e7976555-d400-40ee-aee9-2907ce9f1e0b?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] reports violence in some polling centers: “when opposition supporters at the Liceo Andrés Bello in Caracas complained of being denied access to the vote count, a colectivo — a gang of at least 150 Maduro supporters on motorbikes — arrived shouting pro-government chants … the men, hooded and wearing black, begin to punch and kick those outside the polling center, injuring multiple people.” International Reactions The lack of credible results means “Venezuela is facing a new political blockade,” reports El País [ https://substack.com/redirect/0244c55c-f96d-41e2-b793-26c6d1f68e5d?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. “The presidential election was the result of a secret agreement between the United States and the Chavista government in Qatar, and viewed by the international community as a way of leading the country towards a democratic normality.” Though regional allies, Cuba, Bolivia and Honduras congratulated Maduro on his second reelection, a number of countries called for a more transparent vote tabulation or called outright fraud. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said his government had “serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people.” (Guardian [ https://substack.com/redirect/ca364837-7204-4220-96b4-caf0fd2ea5a9?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, tweeted: “Maduro’s regime must understand that the results it has published are hard to believe … Chile will not recognize any result that is not verifiable.” Colombia joined calls for a total vote count, while Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo said the country received the official results “with many doubts. This is why electoral observation mission reports are essential, and today more than ever, must defend Venezuelans' votes.\" (Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/de05b463-ab5e-4e2f-aae0-c2a64bace5e6?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Germany [ https://substack.com/redirect/f134c680-a229-4597-88c9-738190133606?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] this morning called “all for the publication of detailed results for all polling stations & access to all voting and election documents for opposition and observers.” And the European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said “Ensuring full transparency in the electoral process, including detailed counting of votes and access to voting records at polling stations, is vital.\" Costa Rica, Peru and Uruguay all rejected what they characterized as a fraudulent vote count. Peru announced it had recalled its ambassador to Venezuela for consultation over the election results.

The ceasefire brokered by the US to enable humanitarian assistance to reach some of the 7 million people displaced by conflict in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a welcome step. Delphin Ntayoma, however, argues [https://theconversation.com/drc-ceasefire-for-humanitarian-aid-is-a-small-step-forward-what-must-happen-next-for-peace-235341] that lasting peace in the DRC requires addressing the conflict's underlying causes.

Tensions in the country are rising as Maduro trails in most polls to opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia [ https://substack.com/redirect/2664dbb9-569b-402b-a53b-b7efec496167?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. The government denied entry into the country to some international election observers. It also closed the land border with Colombia on Thursday, leaving many Venezuelans from the eastern state of Mérida trapped in Cúcuta [ https://substack.com/redirect/0750c774-9898-414d-88f5-0e7e0e621c12?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Current President Nicolas Maduro, who took power in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chávez, is facing the greatest challenge to his power in his career. His popularity has plummeted over the last decade as the country plunged into economic and political crisis. Eight million people have fled the country since 2014. Police crackdowns in the country have left nearly 20,000 people dead [ https://substack.com/redirect/1b4ed371-3f3b-4122-a5f3-b33907604cf8?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], killings that peaked in 2017, and hundreds of people have been jailed for their political affiliations. Given the presence of international observers, and the security of vote-counting software, outright fraud, if it happens, will be traceable. But that doesn’t mean there won’t be hijinks. Voter suppression efforts are already underway. Despite agreements as part of the Barbados Accords, agreements between the government and opposition representatives, voter rolls have not been updated, and the vast majority of Venezuelans abroad, nearly 25% of the country’s population, will not be able to participate in elections. But despite polling, Maduro has been projecting confidence in recent weeks, saying at a rally on Thursday that his party will win “by hook or by crook”. The government is relying on massive turn-out-the-vote operations among supporters. Today’s feature will be a little different. We will be providing updates and live coverage throughout the elections. If you’re reading this by email, please check the website periodically. We will be watching and in contact with people on the ground across the country. And we even have a few Venezuelans stopping by the desk here to help us out. We’ll be updating with their thoughts as well. PWS is officially launching it’s first real-time coverage of breaking news as part of elections in Venezuela.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://latinamericadailybriefing.substack.com/p/all-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about Venezuelans will vote in a watershed presidential election on Sunday. The election is neither free nor fair, Nicolás Maduro’s government has engaged in years of political repression, and drastically limited independent media and civil society. Nonetheless, it is the most significant challenge to Maduro’s hold on power in nearly a decade. It is the first time since 2015 that the most important opposition parties are participating in a national election, and polls give the opposition Plataforma Unida Democrática coalition an important advantage. Candidates closed their campaigns yesterday. Edmundo González Urrutia, a relatively unknown retired diplomat, is the surprise unity candidate for the opposition. He has campaigned alongside poll leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running for office. In a video Maduro said that only he could \"guarantee peace and stability,\" while Gonzñalez Urrutia urged Venezuelans to not let \"the message of hate... intimidate you.\" (AFP [ https://substack.com/redirect/9d808ad9-71f9-4483-ac1e-84f7baed9b3b?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Neither Free nor Fair Though González and Machado have been permitted to campaign, the Maduro government has arrested over a hundred people in politically motivated cases, most associated with the PUD campaign and 72 since the beginning of the campaign on July 4, according to Foro Penal. (Human Rights Watch [ https://substack.com/redirect/6354a121-6e43-4be7-8cb1-8421e227cbd1?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Advocacy groups estimate nearly 290 people are detained nationwide for political reasons. In addition to political repression, the government has intensified constraints against independent media and organizations of civil society. And electoral authorities have sought to stack the deck in favor of Maduro, from a questionable ballot design to reducing ballot boxes in polling stations in order to slow down voting and complicate monitoring. (Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/fb287ebc-5bd3-4748-b2d7-399d2c475107?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/66e39377-dd49-4457-888d-58228bbdbb82?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/f09d3e46-9e9c-477f-8199-9e756433757e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Additionally, Maduro has leveraged alliances with criminal actors, part of the regime’s “hybrid criminal governance model,” reports InSight Crime [ https://substack.com/redirect/6a1047fb-57c4-4fc3-bac3-4b74c6a23054?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. “Maduro’s government has not hesitated to deploy its criminal allies when threatened in the past. In the lead up to the elections, state security forces and non-state armed groups (NSAGs) have cooperated to intimidate opposition candidates and suppress their supporters.” There will be limited international observation of the election — in May Venezuelan electoral authorities rescinded an invitation to European Union observers. The Carter Center will be present and the UN will send an Electoral Technical Team. (Human Rights Watch [ https://substack.com/redirect/6354a121-6e43-4be7-8cb1-8421e227cbd1?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) However, the opposition coalition has recruited volunteers to observe 98% of polling stations, reports the Washington Post [ https://substack.com/redirect/3512fe78-7119-4769-9be3-a347c6e07e28?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Brazil’s top electoral court announced it was cancelling an observation mission after critical comments about its electoral system from Maduro and, former Argentine President Alberto Fernández said he was asked to cancel his plans to observe the election after warning Maduro that he must leave power if losing the election. Fernández essentially paraphrased a statement by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva who voiced concern after Maduro warned that an electoral loss would lead to a “bloodbath.” (Bloomberg [ https://substack.com/redirect/3d44c371-aa79-4d93-9c01-e971baf51d2d?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], Buenos Aires Times [ https://substack.com/redirect/8e2bee04-80dd-47e3-9988-dec414ee8751?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) The U.S. government voiced concern yesterday about the threat of violence in the and warned Maduro of the need to hold a fair vote free of political repression or intimidation. (Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/460816bf-b336-4e6f-b992-fa5643ded656?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) International pressure, from the United States, Brazil and Colombia has been key in ensuring the election thus far, and advocates say foreign governments’ reactions to Sunday’s outcome will be key. Scenarios There are several potential scenarios for the election: a) Maduro wins; b) the government steals the election; c) Maduro concedes defeat; d) no results are announced immediately. (Caracas Chronicles [ https://substack.com/redirect/13095d2b-3170-4a04-90c5-752547e5dc82?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Most serious polling puts González far ahead of Maduro, by as much as 20 to 30 points. But some analysts temper this finding. Pollsters have erred in favor of the opposition in elections since 2017, notes David Smilde in Responsible Statecraft [ https://substack.com/redirect/36967b3b-2f00-4a28-b183-51bf4653de76?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], due to factors that include outdated census information, and the extraordinary pressure exerted by the government to ensure turnout among its voters. Massive fraud will be evident because the electronic voting machines have been audited and because of the poll witness at voting centers. “One possible scenario would be long delays in announcing the results — something that with electronic machines should be available quickly. Extended delays will suggest that the government is losing and is figuring out what to do. The government may try to disqualify results from certain centers, candidates or parties to ensure Maduro comes out on top. Or it could concede defeat. Despite all it has to lose, this scenario is not impossible. Even if it loses the presidency, Chavismo will still control the other branches of government, and there are five long months between the election and the investiture in January 2025, during which agreements could be forged.” Opposition unity has been a key factor in the campaign, and a Chatham House [ https://substack.com/redirect/7bc5272b-3b61-4d5f-bde4-a5e8d5e02133?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] report notes that there have been benefits to participating in elections even where conditions are suboptimal. “Over time, when the opposition participated in elections, as it did in 2015 and 2021, it reclaimed electoral power and space. In 2015, opposition parties won a majority in the national assembly elections, though the supreme electoral tribunal stole a supermajority from them. In 2021, they gained municipal and state seats in regional and local elections.” In defense of polling, Delphos director Félix Seijas Rodríguez notes that the gap between opposition supporters and chavistas has never been greater, and could overcome government efforts to suppress turnout and “slice away” at opposition voters. The hope of the opposition is that the vote will be “too big to steal.” (Americas Quarterly [ https://substack.com/redirect/95b241d4-44e7-448c-9361-70b5c6be4585?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Among the many potential outcomes, “a clearly fraudulent result would likely trigger street protests,” according to an Atlantic Center [ https://substack.com/redirect/c4455dc4-9803-42bb-b478-d13453d96cb0?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] memo. “As in previous protest waves in 2014, 2017, and 2019, this may lead to clashes with security forces, but the prospect of these mobilizations forcing a change in government is highly unlikely. All eyes will be on Machado to gauge how she would react to low turnout or electoral fraud, and what each would mean for the prospect of unrest. The security forces will likely be reluctant to engage in massive repression on the scale seen in the 2014 and 2017 protests, given how this fueled international condemnation and the investigation of International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan.” Most analysts concur that any possibility of a transition will require a negotiated offramp for Maduro and allies, in particular immunity from prosecution. Many have called on international actors to support such a negotiation ahead of the elections. “In a transition scenario, the key takeaway is that a González win won’t just be handed to him, even in the best-case scenario. It comes with challenges and concessions,” argues James Bosworth [ https://substack.com/redirect/f7a8f546-95c7-418f-b3e9-7abc3c80d0d4?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. “My base case (60% likely) is that Maduro successfully steals the election and then represses the protests afterward and navigates the international criticism that comes his way. I’m estimating that the odds of transition are 25%. The remaining 15% of scenarios are some form of post-election chaos and violence.” (Latin America Risk Report [ https://substack.com/redirect/f7a8f546-95c7-418f-b3e9-7abc3c80d0d4?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) According to one source cited in the Financial Times [ https://substack.com/redirect/237a300b-3761-43f1-92e7-09302ab0fbf1?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]: “The best-case scenario is that the government pauses the count in the event of an opposition victory, and starts negotiating.” More Venezuela Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/f9e27803-e03a-4b6a-8c31-248dbddd6268?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] has a timeline of Maduro’s time in power. The UNHCR estimates that more than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America’s recent history — the vast majority cannot vote in Sunday’s election. (Associated Press [ https://substack.com/redirect/4371ab56-886f-4c1c-bc77-b588591d0aa0?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Venezuela’s climate and energy policies are also at stake in Sunday’s election, writes Luisa Palacios in Americas Quarterly [ https://substack.com/redirect/34ea6a6d-d00d-407b-b24e-bc2694e8a50d?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Migration A U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimate predicts that increased immigration to the U.S. is expected to drive higher economic growth and labor supply, grow federal revenues and shrink deficits over the next 10 years, reports Axios [ https://substack.com/redirect/e7a40f9c-f65c-4dc6-a71c-14dc2778451e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. The report focuses on people who cannot legally work in the US, a group that “is expected to “generate $1.175 trillion in increased federal revenue in the 2024-2034 period and $270 billion in mandatory outlays and net federal spending for a net decrease of $897 billion in the federal deficit,” reports The Hill [ https://substack.com/redirect/28df6d06-abb3-4d86-89b4-7f87b8ae2370?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Regional Legendary Sinaloa Cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García was arrrested at a private airport in Texas. Zambada has evaded jail and had a $15 million bounty on his head. Authorities also detained Joaquín Guzmán López, one of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s sons, reports El País [ https://substack.com/redirect/c43fce9e-fea5-4bc0-b276-8c2e3ce683be?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Initial accounts suggest it was a betrayal by the younger Guzmán, reports the New York Times [ https://substack.com/redirect/e59d3d71-afde-49e3-9e0d-d6f02b96bb8c?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Zambada García “was unaware he was headed to the United States when he boarded a private airplane with Mr. Guzmán López, who told him they were going to look at some real estate properties, according to two American law enforcement officials who were briefed on the situation.” But others dispute this account and say Zambada García cut a deal with U.S. law enforcement, according to Ioan Grillo: “I have issues with both explanations. On one side, I find it hard to accept that Mayo with his vast experience and status would need to go on a plane to inspect crops and fall into U.S. hands. But on the other, a deal for Mayo could be tricky as he is at the top level so it would be hard to make him a witness on a bigger target.” (CrashOut [ https://substack.com/redirect/e24d0abb-7231-4c5c-a840-06c2bce7b4ba?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) “The charges are part of a crackdown on Sinaloa cartel leaders,” reports the Guardian [ https://substack.com/redirect/5a391857-5b6f-4b7a-b82a-7e53612a6775?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. “Last year, the US justice department charged more than two dozen members of the Sinaloa cartel, including the sons of notorious drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, accusing them of supplying precursor chemicals required to make fentanyl.” Don’t try this at home: Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/3538feea-6f15-4850-be41-c20c5891a4d6?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] investigators purchased the ingredients needed to make $3 million worth of fentanyl online for just $3,600.

India’s imports from China have more than doubled since the Covid epidemic. China’s export prowess is a magnet that realigns all of Asia’s economies around its economic sphere. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/china-quietly-taking-the-lead-in-climate-diplomacy/?mc_cid=2361ca1763&mc_eid=UNIQID ** China quietly taking the lead in climate diplomacy (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/china-quietly-taking-the-lead-in-climate-diplomacy/?mc_cid=2361ca1763&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Xu Yi-Chong China is emerging as a global leader in climate diplomacy, advancing initiatives to combat climate change while promoting green technologies.

DePetris The idea of forming an \"Asian NATO\" to counter China’s rise is unnecessary and potentially destabilizing. Regional security can be effectively maintained through existing alliances and partnerships. Strengthening economic ties and diplomatic engagement, rather than military blocs, is a more sustainable approach to addressing the challenges posed by China’s growing influence. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/can-kamala-harris-beat-donald-trump/?mc_cid=2361ca1763&mc_eid=UNIQID ** Can Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump?

Harris faces the challenge of solidifying her base while appealing to swing voters. Her campaign strategy, public perception, and the political climate will play crucial roles in determining whether she can secure a victory against the former president. She has a good chance of doing so. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/us-targets-hong-kong-chip-transshipments-to-russia/?mc_cid=2361ca1763&mc_eid=UNIQID ** US targets Hong Kong chip transshipments to Russia (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/us-targets-hong-kong-chip-transshipments-to-russia/?mc_cid=2361ca1763&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Jeff Pao The United States is cracking down on Hong Kong's role in transshipping semiconductors to Russia, aiming to tighten sanctions and prevent technology transfer. China and Hong Kong, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are among the countries of concern that are sourcing computer numeric control (CNC) machine tools for Russia, according to a Washington-based non-profit. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/china-cuts-key-rate-amid-worst-deflation-since-99/?mc_cid=2361ca1763&mc_eid=UNIQID ** China cuts key rate amid worst deflation since ’99 (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/china-cuts-key-rate-amid-worst-deflation-since-99/?mc_cid=2361ca1763&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By William Pesek Pan Gongsheng isn’t famed for acrobatic skills. But on Monday, the People’s Bank of China governor embarked on a routine that will test his monetary balance, agility and motor coordination in tantalizing ways.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://boz.substack.com/p/friday-reading-list-and-venezuela Good morning and happy Friday from Virginia! I’m back from a road trip and will hopefully get back on track with regular newsletter writing in the coming weeks. For World Politics Review, I wrote about Lula vs Milei [ https://substack.com/redirect/3be38d13-a6f2-4910-9f90-bd0a9644edff?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Here are some Venezuela comments plus this week’s reading list. Venezuela comments Once turnout factors are modeled in, I estimate that Edmundo González has a 10-15 point lead in the race. This race is about 54-42 in favor of the opposition. That gap means the opposition is nearly certain (>95%) to turn out more voters than the governing party. The question is then how the votes are counted. The gap means the governing party will need to engage in both mesa-level ballot stuffing and some sort of manipulation of the count to pull off an announced victory, and that fraud should be obvious to international observers. Opposition witnesses should have proof that the vote is stolen. My base case (60% likely) is that Maduro successfully steals the election and then represses the protests afterward and navigates the international criticism that comes his way. I’m estimating that the odds of transition are 25%. The remaining 15% of scenarios are some form of post-election chaos and violence. The odds of a transition at 25% are high, up from 15% a few months ago, but not as high as they were in 2019 at the start of the Guaidó push. Maduro is in a stronger place than he was in 2019. Getting to odds that are better than an inside straight draw in poker is proof of how well Machado and the opposition have run this campaign. They still need a whole lot to go correct to succeed. If the question comes down to “will González/Machado do the right thing?” in a critical moment in the coming weeks, I think the answer is most certainly yes. The Biden administration is also smart enough to make the right moves if the opportunity presents itself. Whether this transition happens is now up to Maduro, the military, and the inner circle of Chavistas. In a transition scenario, the key takeaway is that a González win won’t just be handed to him, even in the best-case scenario. It comes with challenges and concessions. The process will go well beyond Sunday night. These sorts of transitions are about the post-election negotiations after the votes are cast and those can take days. Even if Maduro successfully steals this election, as is the most likely scenario, the opposition should be proud to have built a real political movement that quite possibly has staying power.

The case for her being the greatest 1,500m athlete in recorded history will be made even stronger if, as expected, she lifts gold at the Paris Olympics on 10 August - making her the first to win the event in three consecutive games. But Kenya must strive for continued success. As distance running medals become more and more contested, the country will need to adapt and advance its pool of talent. Sports scientist Wycliffe W. Njororai Simiyu outlines [https://theconversation.com/faith-kipyegon-is-set-to-make-olympics-history-what-kenya-needs-to-do-to-keep-producing-athletes-like-her-234950] seven key ways to do this. Kenya’s President William Ruto has appointed new figures to cabinet.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://evanellis.substack.com/p/evan-ellis-elections-in-venezuela Dear Colleague, As Venezuela’s critically important (possible) July 28 election approaches, I am proud to share with you my new work, “Elections in Venezuela: Hoping for the Best, preparing for the Worst,” on what the opposition, the U.S. and the region should be thinking about now as the event approaches. While I extend my heartfelt hopes and best wishes to Venezuela’s opposition, and applaud the courage and character with which Maria Corina Machado, Edmundo Gonzalez and the rest of the opposition has run the present unprecedented electoral campaign…I argue that the Maduro regime has every incentive to steal or postpone the election, or undermine its outcome, in order to avoid the feared consequences of criminal prosecution that could come with losing power. Every action it has taken in the past 25 years of political struggle to capture and dominate Venezuela’s institutions are consistent with such a course. Everything in its past experience in facing down major protests in 2007, 2014, 2017, and 2019-2020 lead it to calculate that a combination of repression and terror by state organs such as SEBIN and the FAES, and unofficially, through collectivos, gangs and other agents, will eventually dissipate even the most massive protest. Their lessons of 25 years is that military and other elites complicit in the regime’s corruption are more afraid of a return to accountability, than they may be disgusted with Chavismo, and that even with some discontents the deep penetration of Cuban agents in security forces prevents any revolt from growing far. Past practice convinces them they have every reason to believe they can weather the worst sanctions and threats the US, the EU and others can throw at them, and that there is no “off-ramp” the gringos can offer them that is less risky than hunkering down. This work looks at what is likely to transpire in the coming days in Venezuela, and thus, the responses to be thinking about now, before it possibly occurs… The work is available for download here in English: It is available for download here in Spanish: The English-language version is available from Indrastra, which published it, at: https://www.indrastra.com/2024/07/venezuelas-elections-hoping-for-best.html The Spanish-language version is available from Infobae, which translated and published it: https://www.infobae.com/america/opinion/2024/07/24/elecciones-en-venezuela-esperando-lo-mejor-preparandose-para-lo-peor/ Podcasts, Media Appearances, and Radio Shows: As always, I would also like to share with you my latest weekly segments on the John Batchelor Show, in his special ongoing series on Latin America, The New World Report.

There is also the possibility that the elections result in a lifting of U.S. sanctions on the sector, which would improve productivity.

But there’s far more richness to Madagascar’s fauna than the iconic lemurs. Madagascar is a biodiversity wonderland. Scientists estimate that about 85% of its animal species and 90% of its plant species are endemic, meaning they aren’t found anywhere else in the world. Its marine and aquatic ecosystems are equally rich in diversity - including a newly discovered species of long-nosed skate that, writes [https://theconversation.com/new-fish-found-off-madagascar-remarkable-long-nosed-skate-discovered-in-the-deep-ocean-233683] Simon Weigmann, has only been found in the Madagascar Ridge, a remote, elevated area of seabed south of the island.

      "Text: Hello friends! Today, here’s a look at what the world — and it is mostly the world, we’ve got little word from inside Vietnam just yet — is saying following the death of Nguyen Phu Trong last week. A lot of reviewing his legacy with a nervous eye to successions ahead. Support Dari Mulut ke Mulut by upgrading today (https://darimulut.beehiiv.com/upgrade) I am really looking forward to photo essays in the days to come and will happily share those next week. See you tomorrow for a huge list of all the best things I read this month. Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/adf257ef-97db-462b-9301-0cb777f97dd2/Vladimir_Putin_and_Nguyen_Phu_Trong__2024-06-20__04.jpg?t=1721865658) Caption: Trong at the Putin visit in Hanoi last month, one of his last public outings Nguyen Phu Trong is dead at 80. The late secretary-general of Vietnam’s Communist Party had the kind of life that so many of the region’s elder-statespeople have — in some ways, his life’s story is that of his country’s. [According to Nikkei Asia’s fantastic obituary](https://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Obituaries/Vietnam-Communist-party-boss-dies-at-80-succession-in-balance), Trong was born in 1944 when Vietnam was still a French colony but occupied by Japan. He joined the Party during the Vietnam War and ‘studied party-building and literature before devoting his career to communism.’ He worked his way up the ranks before taking the top job in 2011. He was eventually given an unprecedented third term as secretary-general. This obituary lists Trong’s three major legacies off the bat — a new era of fruitful relations with the US, striking a balance with neighbouring China and kicking the anti-corruption campaign, or ‘burning furnace,’ into gear. This is a good framework, so let’s work through it. Vietnam has been increasingly important to the US, particularly in securing manufacturing and production security amid its own rivalry with China. [Rebecca Tan for the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/18/vietnam-nguyen-phu-trong/) notes this extends to security as the geo-political situation remains fraught. ‘Vietnam has sought to use Washington as a counterweight to Beijing, especially in the face of increased Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, which is claimed in part by Vietnam,’ Tan writes. View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1f31ab59-06ba-4707-9568-9991d1e2caee/Secretary_Pompeo_Joins_President_Trump_in_Meetings_with_Vietnamese_President_Nguye%CC%82%CC%83n_Phu%CC%81_Tro%CC%A3ng__32283463547_.jpg?t=1721865573) Caption: Trong, Trump and Ho Chi Minh in 2019 Vietnam doesn’t exactly see itself the same way — it is a sovereign nation, after all — but has been quick to take advantage. US President Joe Biden made a visit to Hanoi last year pledging friendship and business, but it’s a [switch in market status that Vietnam wants](https://www.rmit.edu.vn/news/all-news/2024/jul/why-the-us-should-recognise-vietnams-market-economy-status). A decision from the US is expected by the end of the month. China’s politburo is mourning a “good comrade, brother and friend,” [the Guardian reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/vietnams-communist-leader-nguyen-phu-trong-dies-aged-80-creating-vast-power-vacuum) of Chinese state media. Vietnam’s ‘bamboo diplomacy,’ which is flexible and bendy, but never breaks, has ensured the country has managed to maintain relations with China even as it buddies up with the US. ‘Xi recalled that over the past decade, he and Trong had maintained close contact and developed a deep camaraderie, and that last year, they jointly announced the elevation of bilateral relations to a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance, a milestone in bilateral ties,’ [China Daily reports](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/22/WS669d914fa31095c51c50f229.html). That great Nikkei read notes that ‘Trong's unrivalled Marxist-Leninist bona fides’ had helped him establish a very tight working relationship with Xi Jinping, who rose to his role just a year after Trong and similarly was extended an unheard-of third term. Over at Fulcrum, Le Hong Hiep and Nguyen Khac Giang were ready to go! This excellent piece looks at Trong’s long legacy dropped before the NYT push notification. As we know and love about Fulcrum, this is far more in-depth than the immediate news analysis and traces Trong’s history as a savvy political player, outwitting his way up the Politburo. ‘As the CPV’s top leader, Trong’s main job is to maintain the Party’s survival and ultimately its hold on power. As such, he often adopted a hardline approach towards perceived threats to regime security,’ the pair write. This explains the strengthening of government institutions, including the Ministry of Public Security, in rooting out corruption in the ranks and a renewed ‘emphasis on revitalising ideology as a means of preventing moral decay among party members.’ But it may not have played out exactly how he had hoped: ‘Trong’s consolidation of power during his anti-corruption crusade had the unexpected consequence of undermining the very institutions he sought to strengthen,’ they write. The pair suggest that the ‘dominance’ of Trong’s leadership saw power centralise within the Politburo and himself specifically ‘thereby weakening the Central Committee and undermining the principle of collective leadership.’ How this works out in the coming years will certainly be interesting to watch. [President To Lam](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/to-lam-profile-07182024155004.html), who rose to the post only a month ago after predecessor Vo Van Thuong was ousted as a major scalp in the anti-corruption drive, has been named temporary general-secretary. To Lam had been running the very powerful Ministry of Public Security prior to the shake-up. I’m not sure if we can say he is ‘widely expected’ to hold on to the gen-sec role after the enormous congress due in 2026, but I am confident in saying no one would be surprised if he did. We might be looking at a different political landscape entirely, Gregory Poling says in this CSIS Q&A, and that makes any prediction tough. ‘Even less clear than who succeeds Trong is whether they will command the same influence. It seems unlikely that any of the leading contenders will command the degree of cross-factional respect that Trong did. If others could easily bridge those divides, Trong would not have been seen as the indispensable man and kept in power for so long. The intraparty struggles and horse trading will be kept from outsiders, rendering any odds-making in the 2026 leadership contest little more than a guessing game.’ Let’s just get through the week first. Vietnam is officially in a state of mourning as of today ahead of tomorrow’s state funeral in Hanoi. Flags are at half-mast and, as [Mike Tatarski spotted in his Vietnam Weekly](https://vietnamweekly.substack.com/p/remembering-nguyen-phu-trong) this morning, news sites have gone greyscale. Communists have a great state funeral aesthetic, but there is that edge of menace we often find in Vietnam. Three Facebook users in Saigon have been fined for spreading ‘untrue news’ about Trong’s death, [RFA reports citing Vietnamese news](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/facebookers-fined-warned-posting-information-nguyen-phu-trong-07222024164456.html). ‘In the days after Trong’s death, the Ho Chi Minh police's cyber security unit detected Vietnamese and foreign nationals using social media to post information deemed to be “unfounded” and intended “to destroy the national unity [and] to humiliate the party and state leaders’ dignity.”’ RFA reports. [There’s an aside in BBC’s report](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y3r09zr2o) that I found interesting. It’s often difficult to get a straight story in Vietnam, but when it comes to Trong’s health over the last few months that is by design. A 2018 law reclassified the health of top officials as a state secret. ‘Intense speculation over his health has long thrived on social media,’ the outlet notes. This had reached fever pitch in recent months as he became a less reliable attendee at various state events. ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

The use of such lands to sell credits also contributes little to reducing carbon emissions.” “The Post’s investigation not only exposes failings in the global system for vetting such ventures but also calls into question the value of some projects in addressing global warming. Much of the Brazilian Amazon is safeguarded by a green shield of publicly protected lands: national forests, Indigenous territory, federal and state reserves.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://evanellis.substack.com/p/evan-ellis-guatemalas-security-challenges Dear Colleague, I am proud to share with you my new working paper on Guatemala’s Security Challenges and the Government Response. The work reflects my conversations with a number of current and former senior Guatemalan officials, academics, and other analysts. The work emphasizes the importance of Guatemala and its effective, democratic governance to the security of the U.S. and the dynamics of the region, given Guatemala’s strategic location spanning the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, with key drug and migrant transit routes through the region, as well as Guatemala’s maintenance of formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the PRC expands its influence and activities with other governments in the area which are increasingly less disposed to work with the U.S. The work looks at the evolving patterns of drug transits, migrants and other activities related to transnational organized crime in Guatemala, as well as the evolution of the initiatives, institutions and assets of the Guatemalan National Police and Military, in partnership with the U.S. and others, in response to those challenges. The final academic version will be available in multiple languages in a forthcoming edition of the Journal of the Americas.

The move is aimed at limiting illegal logging.

They’ve edited the only vaccine against tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, making it more effective in limiting the growth of tuberculosis in the lungs of mice. One of the lead researchers, Bavesh Kana, explains [https://theconversation.com/tb-gene-editing-could-add-new-power-to-a-100-year-old-vaccine-233687] the science behind this process and what it means for future vaccine development. Countrywide protests in Kenya have been accompanied by police shootings, mass arrests and calls for the president to step down. This has evoked memories of another era: the 24-year-rule of Daniel arap Moi during which the former president ruled with an iron fist. But Kenya today is very different from what it was then. Political scientist Gabrielle Lynch unpacks [https://theconversation.com/kenyas-former-president-daniel-arap-moi-mastered-the-art-of-silencing-critics-why-his-tactics-wouldnt-work-today-235026] the tactics Moi worked to silence dissent and why they can’t work today.

      "Text: Hello friends! Only Manila can put on a show like that. Sure, a red carpet and gowns rivalling a Hollywood awards show can seem a bit naff for a State of the Nation Address, a little Hunger Games even. [But I’m a sucker for Heart Evangelista](https://www.instagram.com/p/C9vsepfyzFd/?hl=en&img_index=1)! Thankfully, President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr’s speech was full of meaningful and insightful comments for us to crack into. Celebrate a SONA with a Dari Mulut ke Mulut upgrade (https://darimulut.beehiiv.com/upgrade) The hard-working journalists and analysts of the Philippines will surely be spending today getting their post-SONA write-ups and commentary pieces together. I’m really looking forward to wading through those and seeing what the eagle-eyed and -eared have noted that the immediate response missed. See you Thursday for a jump over to Vietnam as preparations for a state funeral and power transition continue. Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/016ecf94-318e-43d2-adde-d1abd73fd03a/20240722-SONA-1-scaled.jpeg?t=1721695211) Caption: Thanks to the PCO for the snap! ## POGOs are gone Or at least, Marcos wants them gone. All Philippine offshore gaming operators, better known by the acronym, will be booted from the country after years of controversy. This controversy hit an all-time high in recent months with the connection between disgraced (and missing) Tarlac mayor Alice Guo putting a renewed lens on the industry with deep links to Chinese criminal syndicates. “Disguising as legitimate entities, their operations have ventured into illicit areas furthest from gaming, such as financial scamming, money laundering, prostitution, human trafficking, kidnapping, brutal torture, even murder. The grave abuse and disrespect to our system of laws must stop,” Marcos said during the speech to cheers and applause from lawmakers in attendance. While POGOs have been declared illegal as of yesterday, state regulator Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp will work to have them all purged from the country by the end of the year, [Inquirer reports](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1964063/marcos-bans-pogo-cites-disorder-it-caused-ph?utm_source=(direct)&utm_medium=gallery). The Department of Labour and Employment has previously flagged around 25,000 Filipinos working in the industry. Marcos vowed to work with the department to retrain those left jobless to find employment elsewhere. This announcement was widely welcomed by watchers, but many have raised concerns already that this will be easier said than done. POGOs have operated in the country since the early 2000s before former president Rodrigo Duterte regulated the industry in the early days of his presidency. There are fears that criminal elements that control POGOs are connected to political elites and will surely attempt to fight back. I think, given the Alice Guo story and the alleged lengths she and her business partners and family have gone to maintain their interests in POGOs, that fear is well-founded. Also! These things just plain old suck. That’s a good enough to reason, in my view. But, it is very early days in this policy and Marcos Jr sure needs a boost in approval — this might be the way to do it. ## Standing ground in the West Philippine Sea “The Philippines cannot yield. The Philippines cannot waver,” Marcos Jr said of his position in the South China Sea. “The West Philippine Sea is not a figment of our imagination. It is ours. And it will remain ours as long as the spirit of our beloved Philippines continues to burn bright,” he said, using the Philippines’ term for the waters (legally) under their control. Rappler reports Marcos’ thundering support for the Philippines in the waters — and his gracious tribute to the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard and the fisherfolk on the frontline — netted him two long standing ovations from lawmakers. Interestingly, [Rappler compares the comments](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/marcos-jr-vows-no-wavering-west-sea-sona-2024/) with Marcos’ two previous SONAs. At his first in 2022, he said he would “not preside over any process that will abandon even one square inch of territory of the Republic of the Philippines to any foreign power.” Last year, he vowed to “protect our sovereign rights and preserve our territorial integrity, in defense of a rules-based international order.” I hope I’m not reading too much into it, but he does appear to be far more confident in his position now. That the speech comes just days after a [fresh breakthrough in communications](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/21/philippines-says-reached-deal-with-china-to-avoid-disputed-shoal-clashes) with China following months of on-water antagonisms and pledges of support from the US and Japan surely has helped shore up (hehe!) his footing. ## It’s the economy, bobo Inflation is starting to chill out — except for rice which is hovering around 20%! — and growth is back on track. But who cares about such things when you’re a worker struggling to make your bills! Dare I say it, I’m impressed Marcos has made that distinction. It does feel a bit uneasy to hear it from the man whose family name is synonymous with ostentatious pilfering of country funds, but this is a comment many world leaders seem to dodge making. “The hard lesson of this last year has made it very clear that whatever current data proudly bannering our country as among the best-performing in Asia means nothing to a Filipino, who is confronted by the price of rice at 45 to 65 pesos per kilo,” Marcos said, [as reported by Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-22/marcos-vows-measures-to-fight-inflation-as-key-to-faster-growth). Yes! It’s true! Getting rice prices down has been a priority for a while now, but Marcos is adding a review into energy prices and new infrastructure projects that will both bring new jobs and improve connectivity. Agriculture is a particular priority for the year ahead, he said. ## Sara Duterte, the ‘designated survivor’ Vice President Sara Duterte told media yesterday that not only was she not planning on attending, she would not watch it at all. “The Vice President will not watch the SONA on TV or gadgets,” her office said yesterday, [as per ABS-CBN](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/2024/7/22/vp-duterte-to-completely-snub-sona-she-will-not-watch-it-on-tv-or-gadgets-1506). Instead, she spent the day in Bohol province, where [Vice Governor Dionisio Victor A. Balite died](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/bohol-vice-governor-dionisio-victor-balite-dies/) last week. “I am bringing a message of hope to Boholanos that we can help each other for the sake of our town,” Duterte said. ## ‘Bloodless’ war on drugs to continue Marcos has benefited greatly from the residual shock of predecessor Rodrigo Duterte’s horrific war on drugs and his own policy rarely gets international attention. Marcos’ ‘bloodless’ war continues, and he made quick reference to it last night. The campaign will continue along the “eight Es of an effective anti-illegal drugs strategy,” none of which are “extermination,” he said. By the [President’s Communications Office’s reckoning](https://pco.gov.ph/news_releases/pbbms-bloodless-anti-illegal-drugs-strategy-nets-biggest-drug-haul-in-ph-history/), the campaign has netted 97,000 arrests. This figure includes ‘more than 6000 high-value targets that included 440 government employees, 42 of which were from the uniformed personnel and 77 were elected officials.’ No, Carlos Conde, senior researcher of the Human Rights Watch said in a statement [as per the Philippine Centre for Investigative Journalism](https://pcij.org/2024/07/22/marcos-third-sona-pcij-blog-issues/#drugs): “President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. not only failed to declare an end to the ‘war on drugs’ or outline a human-rights based approach to illegal drugs — he made the spurious and baseless claim that the continuing anti-drug campaign has been bloodless.” ‘From June 30, 2023 to July 1 this year, 360 deaths in anti-illegal drug operations were recorded. A third or 34.3 percent of these had been blamed on agents of the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), or Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP),’ PCIJ reported. ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

The disturbing story of two 1904 marathon runners View in browser https://theconversationafrica.cmail20.com/t/r-e-tdjkhily-nyuldhjci-jy/ Africa Edition | 22 July 2024 [https://theconversation.com] Who were the first Africans to compete at the Olympic Games? The answer is a complex and awful story about two marathon runners from South Africa who were part of a delegation to attend the 1904 St Louis World’s Fair, which was staged in tandem with the Olympics. Reminiscent of human zoos, the fair held athletic days for “savages”. South Africans Jan Mashiani and Len Tau competed at the fair and then went on to enter the Olympic marathon, where officials were unable to pronounce their names. Sports historian Francois Cleophas recounts [https://theconversation.com/who-were-the-first-africans-at-the-olympics-the-disturbing-story-of-two-1904-marathon-runners-234429] this dastardly tale. Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces was created in 2013 by dictator Omar al-Bashir. A decade later, the paramilitary force is at the centre of a war that has caused widespread violence and a humanitarian crisis. The force used military, economic and political strategies to secure state power. Federico Manfredi Firmian outlines [https://theconversation.com/how-militia-groups-capture-states-and-ruin-countries-the-case-of-sudans-rapid-support-forces-234650] the group’s rise, which is illustrative of what can go wrong when armed groups infiltrate state institutions.

      "Text: Hello friends! We’re going to have a bit of a different week this week. Usually, I like to do my Monday newsletter and then two regional round-ups at some stage during the week. But we’ve got a lot going on — mostly just Vietnam and the Philippines, but both countries are really going for it — so I’m going to mix it up this week. Today, a look ahead. And then we’ll catch up with it all as the week plays out. These Monday newsletters are always free for all readers. If you’d like to support that please join us here: Support Dari Mulut ke Mulut (https://darimulut.beehiiv.com/upgrade) See you tomorrow for a post-SONA recap. Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/198ea24c-7f6b-4656-ae27-871ecb384576/rogan-yeoh-rmZ47uGZPQk-unsplash.jpg?t=1721608317) Caption: These flags will be lower later in the week (Photo by [Rogan Yeoh](https://unsplash.com/@roganyeoh?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-red-and-yellow-flag-hanging-from-the-side-of-a-building-rmZ47uGZPQk?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)) ## 🇻🇳 Vietnam in mourning after death of Nguyen Phu Trong Vietnam will enter two days of national mourning on Thursday and Friday, the government said over the weekend following the death of Nguyen Phu Trong, [Reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-hold-state-funeral-late-communist-party-leader-trong-next-week-2024-07-20/). A state funeral will be held on Friday. By the sounds of it, Vietnam will grind to a halt for those days with no public entertainment permitted and a hell of a lot of flags at half-mast. Nguyen Phu Trong was, of course, the general-secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party before he died on Friday. President To Lam temporarily took on his duties from Thursday. [Nikkei Asia has a very extensive and intriguing obituary](https://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Obituaries/Vietnam-Communist-party-boss-dies-at-80-succession-in-balance) here that highlights Trong’s legacy as a leader who brought the country into the spotlight of the world stage and the consolidation of power-era through the anti-corruption purges beginning during the pandemic. That second point is the one I’m more interested in and I’m really looking forward to revisiting later in the week as all the analysis comes in. ## 🇵🇭 Ahead of SONA, Sara puts herself under suspicion with terrible gag State of Nation Address. Oh my days, no one does it like the Philippines. From 3pm Manila-time today, every news outlet in the country will be singularly focused on the annual event. President Bongbong Marcos has a hell of a lot to chat about this year from the post-pandemic economic recovery to the South China Sea. But for gossipy outsiders like myself, the real story is that Vice President Sara Duterte has declined to attend. That in itself is interesting, given how huge the address is. Then she had to go and say something bananas: She won’t be there because she’s the self-appointed ‘designated survivor.’ Such a thing does not exist in the Philippines and the response to the comment has ranged from eye-rolling to wondering if she’s making a bomb threat. [You all just didn’t get it](https://www.gmanetwork.com/regionaltv/news/102951/vp-saras-designated-survivor-statement-not-a-joke/story/), she said. I was so impressed with Marcos Jr’s speech at the Shangri La Dialogue earlier this year I am, dare I say it, looking forward to this afternoon. If he can bring that energy and insight to domestic issues, I think it could be very valuable. Also will be keeping my eyes peeled for Heart Evangelista, who will certainly treat the event like it’s the Oscars. ## 🇹🇭 Srettha heads back to court Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thaivisin will be back in court Wednesday, [Reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-court-sets-july-24-next-hearing-date-pm-srettha-removal-case-2024-07-10/). “The court calls for more information including evidence and from individuals that were previously summoned,” the Constitutional Court said in a statement. It doesn’t sound like it’ll be particularly juicy, but with his job on the line and the Court vowing an outcome by September who can say! Move Forward watchers will have to [wait until Aug. 7](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-court-sets-aug-7-verdict-date-move-forward-party-dissolution-case-2024-07-17/). ## 🇮🇩 Transition reaches key ministry, but nepotism criticism lurks President Joko Widodo is on his way out and Prabowo Subianto is on the way in. Good news for Thomas Djiwandono, nephew and financial affairs adviser to Prabowo, who was last week sworn in as a deputy finance minister. The transition in this ministry is being widely watched, with many of Prabowo’s flagship policies very fiscally ambitious. “The addition of Thomas will make it much easier to communicate,” Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said at a joint press conference last week, [as reported by Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/prabowos-nephew-be-appointed-indonesia-deputy-finmin-sources-say-2024-07-18/). ## 🇲🇾 Mahathir is in hospital Mahathir Mohamad, former prime minister of Malaysia (twice) and freshly 99 years old, has been hospitalised for a bad cough, [Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/malaysia-ex-pm-mahathir-hospitalized-since-monday-for-coughing). He went to the National Heart Institute last Monday. There has not been much of an update since on how he is travelling — or even if he is still in — but given his age and bumpy health issues earlier in the year, it is definitely worth flagging. ## Interesting reads [TikTok e-commerce grows fourfold in ASEAN, narrows gap with Shopee](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/TikTok-e-commerce-grows-fourfold-in-ASEAN-narrows-gap-with-Shopee) (Nikkei Asia) _Since its e-commerce debut in 2021, TikTok has launched a hiring spree in Southeast Asia, where incumbent players have reduced headcounts in an effort to become profitable. By 2023, TikTok quadrupled its employees to over 8,000 and became on par with Lazada, Momentum Works said._ _In particular, TikTok grew its e-commerce feature by leveraging its livestreaming function, where influencers and merchants show everything from beauty and fashion products to home appliances to help users make purchases in real time._ [Cyanide poisoning suspected in six deaths at Bangkok hotel ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/17/cyanide-plot-suspected-in-bangkok-hotel-deaths)(Al Jazeera) _Authorities appeared eager to stress that the crime is of a “private” nature and there is no security threat to Thailand’s key tourism sector. It is suspected that one of the six deceased laced tea with the deadly chemical in connection with a dispute over money._ _“We found cyanide in the teacups – all six cups we found cyanide,” Trirong Phiwpan, commander of the Thai police forensic division, said at a news conference. “After staff brought tea cups and two hot water bottles, milk and teapots, … one of the six introduced cyanide.”_ [Strife-torn Myanmar marks 77th anniversary of the assassination of independence hero Gen. Aung San](https://apnews.com/article/aung-san-suu-kyi-martyrs-day-assassination-e256fdfeff6097d9ebfe28a9a002ad31) (AP) _Myanmar’s military government held a wreath-laying ceremony in the country’s largest city Friday to mark the anniversary of the assassination of the country’s fallen independence heroes, including Gen. Aung San, the father of the country’s ousted leader, Aung San Suu Kyi._ _Neither Suu Kyi, who is imprisoned, nor Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the current head of the army-led government, attended this year’s main ceremony at the Martyrs’ Mausoleum near the foot of the towering Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon. Min Aung Hlaing led the army’s 2021 seizure of power from Suu Kyi’s elected government._ ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://www.piratewireservices.com/p/us-elections-are-dominating-the-news International headlines this week have been dominated by elections news in the United States. Amidst an assassination attempt against Donald Trump, drama over whether President Joe Biden will stay in the race, and a series of scandals at the Republican National Convention, Latin America went rather ignored in most English-language media. But fear not! PWS has you covered. Instead of our usual long-form feature article, we thought it might be fun to bring you all the important stories in in Latin America that the big media companies missed. The Trump/Bukele breakup And we can start with a falling out between two of the most dominant right-wing strongmen leaders in the Americas. Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, has in recent years become a rising star among the “law and order” right— not just in Latin America, and Donald Trump, ex-president and the current frontrunner in U.S. presidential elections in November. The self-proclaimed “coolest dictator in the world”, spoke at CPAC, in the U.S. in February, and received a hero’s welcome [ https://substack.com/redirect/565dc425-554b-4a8c-a699-2f623cdb931d?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. After an authoritarian crackdown reduced crime in the country — as well as imprisoned over 2% of El Salvador’s population — Bukele won re-election in the country in a landslide despite second presidential terms being prohibited by Constitutional law [ https://substack.com/redirect/7478ee82-3850-481c-8e68-69f086fa3643?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Trump and Bukele enjoyed a good relationship during Trump’s time as president. The Biden administration has continued largely turning a blind eye towards human rights violations, democratic backsliding, and abuses of power by Bukele in exchange for cooperation on migration issues [ https://substack.com/redirect/70c284ad-e667-4691-a3f6-4081a20799db?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Bukele has often supported Trump even after he left the presidency and criticized legal proceedings [ https://substack.com/redirect/4fd50c27-dbdd-4030-a010-fb71003be887?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] against the former president in the U.S. as an erosion of democracy. Bukele’s supporters across the region are generally fans of Trump as well. But during a long and rambling acceptance speech at the RNC, Trump attacked his former ally, falsely claiming that El Salvador, among other countries in the region, is sending their criminals to the U.S. in an effort to get rid of them. There is no evidence this claim is true for any country in Latin America. [ https://substack.com/redirect/09f47c8d-dcb0-43c9-85c0-0a5586303c7d?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] The comments sparked confusion, backlash, and even denial among Bukele supporters in Latin America, with some speculating that Trump confused Bukele with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, but that seems belied by Trump’s speech itself. In addition to naming Bukele, he also referred to “a 70% drop in crime”, and “someone I got along great with in my first term”— neither descriptors that could be applied to Maduro. Bukele responded to the remarks only indirectly, tweeting “Taking the high ground”, and not addressing Trump’s comments or accusations. The episode illustrates a tension, however, between MAGA supporters in Latin America and their North American cousins. As much as elites in Latam may consider themselves “part of the club”, it is clear that U.S. Republicans do not return the sentiment. In related news, a report by Human Rights Watch [ https://substack.com/redirect/1531796e-25a6-4d1a-8635-3e066848dbe5?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] this week identified over 3,000 minors who have been detained under Bukele’s “state of exception”, some of which have been subjected to treatment that amounts to torture [ https://substack.com/redirect/c17079aa-2403-4315-9ebc-a3530674d86b?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Panama As we have covered here at PWS before, Panama’s new President, José Raúl Mulino, has promised to close the Darien Gap [ https://substack.com/redirect/879e3cfb-7527-4c7f-97f6-a30f7480fdff?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. The government has already erected razor wire obstacles on some of the main migrant trails— though they are more an inconvenience than a real closure, easily walked around. As part of reporting for stories on the subject, PWS has spoken with immigrants who have recently crossed the Darien as well as experts on the border regions. The obstacles, as well as promised deportation flights funded by the U.S., are more symbolic than practical barriers. Only a very small percentage of arrivals into Panama are actually being deported. Nonetheless, the government claimed on Wednesday that the optics are having an effect. Numbers dropped in late July [ https://substack.com/redirect/7766eb4d-a072-4685-80b3-3b7514c23c6d?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] compared to previous months, though other factors may be more responsible than government actions, including seasonal cycles which tend to ebb in the winter and Summer. Racism at Copa America Argentina defeated Colombia 1-0 in the championship game of the Copa Americana last Sunday. But footage [ https://substack.com/redirect/dbb6a211-93c5-41d0-9375-96068a6d9b23?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] of aftergame celebrations posted by Enzo Fernández, who also plays for Chelsea, on his Instagram account appeared to show him and his teammates involved in chants that included racist and homophobic slurs about members of the France team. Fernández later apologized, saying the video did not “reflect my beliefs or my character”. The French Football Association immediately condemned the video [ https://substack.com/redirect/f5a5659f-399a-4a1e-a066-2b83f1d6b0ef?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], and Fernández will face disciplinary action from the Chelsea football club. FIFA has also launched an investigation. The video has inspired public debate about racism in Argentina, conversations that have at times become heated. Argentine Vice President Victoria Villarruel, in response to conversations about systemic racism in the country, said [ https://substack.com/redirect/78a0d1f2-c8de-4267-954a-28668865f8e4?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] that Argentina “never had second-class citizens” and “never imposed our way of life on anyone” two days before the centenary of the Argentine state massacring 500 Indigenous people. It is not the first time that Villarruel has engaged in historical denialism. She also regularly, and without evidence, claims that the number of dissidents killed during Argentina’s military dictatorship has been exaggerated by historians.

Uncontacted tribe in Peru emerges Rare photographs of an uncontacted indigenous community, the Mascho Piro [ https://substack.com/redirect/470c65ec-8100-440d-ba16-05531a1bdc7c?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], the largest uncontacted tribe in the world, emerged this week in Peru. Roughly 50 Mashco Piro people have appeared in southeastern Peru, in recent days near forests being logged by commercial interests. In a separate incident, another group, of 17, appeared near the neighboring village of Puerto Nuevo, near another indigenous nation, the Yine community The Yine, who are not uncontacted, speak a language related to Mashco Piro, and have previously reported that the Mashco Piro angrily denounced the presence of loggers on their land. Several logging companies hold timber concessions inside the territory that belongs to the Mashco Piro people. The nearest is just a few miles from where the Mashco Piro was filmed. One company, Canales Tahuamanu, that operates inside the Mashco Piro territory has built more than 200 km of roads for its logging trucks to extract timber. It is certified by the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) for its supposedly sustainable and ethical operations there, despite the Peruvian government acknowledging eight years ago that it is cutting down trees within Mashco Piro territory. You can view all of the photos and videos here [ https://substack.com/redirect/99f672a1-4f9a-4c58-911f-b1b72d52a4e2?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Venezuela goes to the polls this Sunday Venezuela holds elections on Sunday, July 28. The government of Nicolas Maduro, which trails in most polling, has arrested leading opposition members in recent weeks. In public statements, Maduro has warned of a popular uprising if the right wing removes him from power. “If they do not want Venezuela to fall into a bloodbath, into a fratricidal civil war,” the ruling party must win the presidential elections on July 28, Maduro told a campaign event in Caracas on Tuesday [ https://substack.com/redirect/704b88e1-b1dd-4276-a60e-dc9ec0477747?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Maduro added that only a victory for his party could preserve peace in the country. The opposition meanwhile says that the removal of Maduro from power would allow the nearly 8 million people who have fled the country since 2015 to finally return home.

Spanish word of the Week Caribear - to Caribe (dominate) As Bukele and Trump fans tried to come to terms with the tension between their two favorite strongmen, public debate raged. We found ourselves reading a lot of comments from all sides of the conversation. As part of that, we kept running into the word Caribear. To be completely honest, we didn’t recognize the word! We had to look it up to understand what people meant when they were saying that Trump was Caribeando Bukele. Turns out, it’s Venezuelan slang for “to dominate” someone, “to exercise dominion over” someone, or, “to manipulate and control through cunning”. We think that’s pretty badass. English doesn’t really have a word for this, but we love that it seems to have evolved from “Caribe”, or the Caribbean. Watch out for those people from the Caribbean!

      "Text: Africa Edition - Today's top story: How old are South African fossils like the Taung Child? New study offers an answer View in browser https://theconversationafrica.cmail19.com/t/r-e-tdjkjkut-nyuldhjci-tl/ Africa Edition | 20 July 2024 [https://theconversation.com] The discovery of a child’s fossilised skull in Taung, South Africa a century ago altered how scientists thought about human evolution. The unearthing of the Taung Child, as the skull became known, was followed by several more important fossil discoveries in the area dubbed the “cradle of humankind”. And all these finds sparked an ongoing debate: exactly how old are South Africa’s Australopithecus africanus fossils? Francis Thackeray explains [https://theconversation.com/how-old-are-south-african-fossils-like-the-taung-child-new-study-offers-an-answer-234088] why he turned to the fossilised teeth of hominins (ancient human ancestors) in search of an answer - and why he believes he’s found it. The 25th International AIDS Conference kicks off in Munich, Germany, on Monday, bringing together the world’s leading clinicians and scientists, policymakers, and people living with HIV. It’s been 40 years since HIV - the virus responsible for AIDS - was isolated by virologists and, in the decades since, tens of millions of people have been affected. The Conversation Africa has previously published many insightful articles on the epidemic that remains one of the world’s greatest contemporary health challenges. Here [https://theconversation.com/the-hiv-epidemic-40-years-on-5-essential-reads-on-breakthroughs-blind-spots-and-new-challenges-234717] are just five.

Ancient Egyptian scribes had the same aches and pains, say researchers View in browser https://theconversationafrica.cmail20.com/t/r-e-tdjkltky-nyuldhjci-jj/ Africa Edition | 19 July 2024 [https://theconversation.com] If you work in an office, you are likely aware of the physical risks that come with it. From hand and wrist injuries because of the excessive use of a mouse to spinal changes from prolonged sitting. A recent study shows these problems aren’t new. The skeletal remains of scribes from ancient Egypt show that our ancestors battled occupational health hazards like osteoarthritis in the jaw, spine, shoulder, thumb and knees. Petra Brukner Havelková and Veronika Dulíková share [https://theconversation.com/is-your-desk-job-killing-your-back-ancient-egyptian-scribes-had-the-same-aches-and-pains-say-researchers-234302] the details of their findings. There appears to be no end in sight for the deadly conflict that has racked the Democratic Republic of Congo for 30 years. Instead, the humanitarian crisis is worsening. A new United Nations report provides a gloomy account of the enormous scale of violence against civilians and dim prospects for peace. Anthoni van Nieuwkerk unpacks [https://theconversation.com/drc-conflict-risks-spreading-african-leaders-must-push-for-solutions-beyond-military-intervention-234693] the report and shares his insights on resolving the dire situation in eastern DRC. The Kenyan president recently fired his cabinet and promised a new, broadbased government in response to a mounting political challenge from the country’s young population. Some have called for a more radical approach to resolving the crisis: dissolving parliament and calling a new election. John Mukum Mbaku sets out [https://theconversation.com/kenyas-president-dissolved-cabinet-after-popular-protests-economist-maps-out-his-limited-options-234931] the daunting task facing the embattled president.

Goldman Donald Trump’s July 17 Bloomberg interview prompted headlines to the effect that “the US would not defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion under his presidency.” He said no such thing: He said that China doesn’t need to invade Taiwan, which lies within range of as much Chinese ordnance as the mainland cares to shoot at it. He said he can’t defend it. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/two-thirds-of-dems-want-biden-out-of-the-race-now/?mc_cid=b126e24d52&mc_eid=UNIQID ** Two-thirds of Dems want Biden out of the race now (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/two-thirds-of-dems-want-biden-out-of-the-race-now/?mc_cid=b126e24d52&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Emma Shortis A recent poll reveals that two-thirds of Democratic voters prefer President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, with concerns over his age and electability driving this sentiment. Biden and his team need to realize there is no way for him to allay these concerns over his decline – simply because he cannot get younger. He cannot prove he is not too old because he is too old. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/yellens-de-dollarization-fears-will-only-get-worse/?mc_cid=b126e24d52&mc_eid=UNIQID ** ------------------------------------------------------------ ** Yellen’s de-dollarization fears will only get worse ------------------------------------------------------------ Subscribe to AT+ Premium (https://asiatimes.com/subscribe-at/?mc_cid=8b250944ca&mc_eid=b9b08c0d21&mc_cid=b126e24d52&mc_eid=UNIQID) to read the latest from William Pesek, who writes that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's fears of de-dollarization are escalating.

For those over 80, Covid-19 can lead to severe complications. Biden, who has been diagnosed with Covid twice before, has received his Covid vaccine and booster shots, and has taken the first dose of the antiviral drug Paxlovid.

It may appear justified because of the internal conflicts in both countries. Nan Tian argues [https://theconversation.com/military-spending-in-drc-and-south-sudan-rose-fastest-in-the-world-society-ends-up-paying-the-price-234317], however, that high military spending has negative implications. It diverts resources from essential public services and increases the political power of the military – with far-reaching consequences. When Senegal’s El Hadji Amadou Dia Bâ won a silver medal in the 400m hurdles at the 1988 Olympic Games, the historic achievement wasn’t just about his talent or commitment. It was also a testament to his country’s drive to develop its athletes to international levels. Senegal is yet to win another medal at the games, which Nalla Socé Fall explains [https://theconversation.com/olympics-senegal-won-silver-in-1988-why-its-never-managed-to-repeat-this-feat-234403] is a clear sign that the country needs to rethink its current sports policies.

      "Text: Hello friends! A look at maritime Southeast Asia today, sans the Philippines which is so busy we’ll check in tomorrow for a pre-SONA special. Upgrade now to support Dari Mulut ke Mulut (https://darimulut.beehiiv.com/upgrade) See you then! Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— ## 🇲🇾 Rulers come together View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/39f3733e-53cf-4f2b-9ac7-fbc98d8ee0fd/Snapinsta.app_451421559_826519192942341_5640491620520697421_n_1080__1_.jpg?t=1721258784) Caption: Current monarch, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, is ready In an era of unusually active political movements on behalf of Malaysia’s monarchy, this week’s Conference of Rulers takes on a new meaning, [writes Shannon Teoh for the Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-s-rulers-meeting-could-make-or-break-government-plans) yesterday. The Conference involves all nine rulers across the country and will touch on topics of enormous significance, including a citizenship ruling that could leave thousands stateless as well as the appointment of a new judge, Teoh writes. This is, of course, still underway, but I cannot get enough of a rulers analysis and this is a great one. Flash your mind back to March this year when Malaysia erupted in outrage (and counter-outrage) over socks snapped at an outlet of convenience chain KK Mart. The socks, embroidered with ‘Allah,’ have been the focus of religious charges offences laid against both the chain and its supplier, Xin Jian Chang. Both were ordered to pay RM60,000 in fines this week at a Shah Alam court, [Malaysiakini reported](https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/711953). “This case has attracted a lot of attention because it involves a religious issue… In future, (everyone should) be more sensitive about issues that involve the sensitivity of the Muslim community or any religion,” Shah Alam Sessions Court judge Muhamad Anas Mahadzir said, [as per Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/kk-super-mart-founder-and-wife-acquitted-of-criminal-charges-over-socks-with-word-allah). As expected, former prime minister Najib Razak has filed an appeal against a ruling barring him from serving his remaining six years under house arrest not jail. It’ll be heard Oct. 7, [Malaysiakini reports](https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/712104). ## 🇮🇩 NU confronts rare scandal Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s largest Islamic organisation (which also makes it the world’s largest, I believe), has really gotten itself into a knot this week. [A meeting earlier in the month](https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/nahdlatul-ulama-meet-with-israel-president-slammed-07162024155540.html) between some members of NU’s youth wing and Israeli President Issac Herzog in Tel Aviv has forced the organisation onto the defensive, apologising to the public and promising that this meeting does not represent a change of heart. Indonesia does not have formal relations with Israel and, while the government hasn’t been particularly fierce, there has been widespread support for Palestine in the community over generations. “We understand that this is something that crossed the line in the context of the current situation [between Israel and Palestine],” NU chairman Yahya Cholil Staquf said on Tuesday, [as per the Jakarta Post](https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2024/07/16/nu-apologizes-lambasts-members-for-tone-deaf-visit-to-israel.html). The meeting was not approved or sanctioned by the executive board, and the five NU activists involved will face sanctions from the NU Jakarta branch. “Perhaps this Israeli lobbyist believed that these kids could help them share Israel’s message [in Indonesia], but in reality, what can they do now with the backlash that followed?” he added. Incoming vice president, Gibran Rakabuming Raka has officially resigned from his post as mayor of Solo in anticipation of inauguration in October. “I have plenty of tasks to do before the inauguration day,” he told reporters on the way out the door, [as per Jakarta Globe](https://jakartaglobe.id/news/gibran-plans-nationwide-tour-after-resigning-as-mayor). He knocked back chatter that he was stepping down earlier than necessary to free him up to campaign for other candidates in the regional elections. Like his brother, perhaps? It’s something [Tenggara Strategics mulled over for the Jakarta Post](https://www.thejakartapost.com/opinion/2024/07/17/analysis-doubt-looms-over-gibrans-role-in-incoming-administration.html). Gibran has been spotted out and about across Java, though he says it’s sharing policies of the incoming Prabowo Subianto. What has this analysis writer’s eyebrow raised though is that while it’s high-profile, it’s in stark contrast to who is actually involved in the transition. The eldest son of the incumbent president is reportedly sitting far away from the action. This line is key: ‘It’s safe to say that Gibran is struggling to prove he is on an equal footing with Prabowo in discussing matters related to the incoming government, regardless of his outward image as the embodiment of Jokowi’s influence in the next administration.’ Maybe it’s by design? Hmm, I don’t think so, but I’m also willing to entertain both that I am not privy to Istana intrigue and that we’re not on firm ground here and probably won’t be for some months yet. Further afield, the new capital of Nusantara is still experiencing major hiccups. The city is set to host its first-ever Independence Day celebrations on Aug. 17, but construction is lagging, [the Jakarta Post reports](https://www.thejakartapost.com/indonesia/2024/07/13/missed-construction-targets-put-capital-relocation-plan-in-limbo.html). Poor weather has forced delays in securing water supply to the city and the development of solar power has only hit 10MW of a planned 50MW. The administration hopes new regulations allowing 95-year lease terms will help investor confidence, [according to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-12/indonesia-offers-95-year-rights-in-new-capital-to-lure-investors). ‘Pioneer businesses could be exempt from local city tariffs and may be allowed to pay for properties in instalments,’ the outlet reports of a government announcement last week. Land disputes are a major issue in the area with a Supreme Audit Agency report finding over 2,000 hectares of land surrounding the city is owned by parties other than the government. Former agriculture minister Syahrul Yasin Limpo goes down. He’s been sentenced to 10 years in prison for ‘corruption-related extortion, abuse of power and bribery involving ministry contracts with private vendors,’ [the Associated Press reports](https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-corruption-verdict-agriculture-minister-c6aba9e25ed5ab454a78bb93505f6606). “The defendant has legally and convincingly been proven guilty of corruption. He wasn’t a good example as a public official, what he has done is counter the government’s efforts to fight corruption and enriched himself by corruption,” presiding Judge Rianto Adam Pontoh said. Officials from the ministry testified that ‘secretariats, directorates general and agencies within the ministry was required to give up 20% of their budgets to Limpo, as though they were indebted to him, and he threatened their jobs if they rejected his demands.’ AP notes he’s the sixth minister from Jokowi’s various cabinets to go down for corruption. ## 🇸🇬 ISA notices about support of terrorism, not Palestine, government says Singaporean authorities have slapped two people with Internal Security Act restriction notices, [Straits Times reports this week](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/self-radicalised-s-porean-teen-14-and-ex-public-servant-33-given-isa-restriction-orders). A 14-year-old unidentified male student and An’nadya An’nahari, a 33-year-old female former public servant, are alleged to have ‘self-radicalised’ since Oct. 7 last year. Neither can leave the country, move or change jobs without prior approval of the Internal Security Department. They also cannot use the internet. The government has stressed the interventions are not because the pair support Palestine, but because they hold beliefs that advocate for harm against non-Muslims and Israel. “Many of us sympathise with the Palestinian cause. I sympathise with the Palestinian cause. They should have their own country and not suffer like this. But sympathy for any foreign cause cannot mean we can support or allow terrorism. Action was taken against a young boy and An’nadya, not because they supported Palestine... Action was taken against the two of them because of their support for armed violence. And in the case of the young boy, because also that he was prepared to engage in armed violence himself,” Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam [told media on Monday](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shanmugam-isa-terrorism-palestine-gaza-israel-hamas-4480496). He also flagged an increase in radicalisation among young people, noting that the teenager is among the youngest to receive an ISA order. Singapore doesn’t care that the US Department of Justice is cooling it on 1MDB architect and runaway, Jho Low. Local police say an Interpol Red Notice chasing his location and a provisional arrest is very much still in effect, [Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-16/singapore-says-fugitive-jho-low-still-wanted-in-1mdb-case). The outlet reminds that the city-state charged him in absentia all the way back in 2016. One day! An Interpol Red Notice seeking the location and provisional arrest of the financier, better known as Jho Low, remains in effect, the police said. Singapore charged Low in absentia and issued a warrant of arrest in 2016. Oof, those key exports keep falling. June data shows non-oil domestic exports dropped a big 8.7 percent on a year earlier, which is wild since it fell only 0.7 percent in May. [The Straits Times reports](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/s-pore-key-exports-fall-87-in-june) an earlier Bloomberg survey of economists expected a 1.3 percent decline. Yeesh! Antitrust klaxon! Grab’s move to buy up the island’s third-biggest taxi company will “significantly reduce” competition in Singapore, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore said last week. Grab and Trans-cab have until the end of this week to reassure CCCS that it will do nothing of the sort or else the merger won’t go ahead, [Nikkei Asia reports](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Transportation/Grab-s-Singapore-taxi-takeover-may-violate-competition-law-watchdog). “This ruling does not change our determination to do everything that we can to offer affordable, reliable transport options to passengers in Singapore,” Yee Wee Tang, Grab Singapore's managing director, said in a statement as per the outlet.

Villavicencio, a former journalist, had run for president last year on an anti-corruption platform until he was gunned down by men on motorcycles.

It’s anyone’s guess what having China-hawk Vance – who’s all-in on revoking Beijing’s “most-favored nation” status – whispering in the president’s ear might mean for a Trump 2.0 presidency. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/china-evs-still-driving-for-eus-protected-markets/?mc_cid=361602d524&mc_eid=UNIQID ** China EVs still driving for EU’s protected markets (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/china-evs-still-driving-for-eus-protected-markets/?mc_cid=361602d524&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Jeff Pao Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are determined to penetrate the European Union's protected markets despite facing regulatory barriers and tariffs. As the EU’s new tariffs are significantly lower than the 100% tariff imposed by the US in May, Chinese EV firms can still survive in the EU, either by absorbing the new tariffs or opening new plants in the region. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/yellens-de-dollarization-fears-will-only-get-worse/?mc_cid=361602d524&mc_eid=UNIQID ** ------------------------------------------------------------ ** Yellen’s de-dollarization fears will only get worse ------------------------------------------------------------ Subscribe to AT+ Premium (https://asiatimes.com/subscribe-at/?mc_cid=8b250944ca&mc_eid=b9b08c0d21&mc_cid=361602d524&mc_eid=UNIQID) to read the latest from William Pesek, who writes that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's fears of de-dollarization are escalating. Amid rising global skepticism of the US dollar, Yellen's concerns reflect growing challenges to its status as the dominant reserve currency, potentially altering global financial dynamics. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/trump-shooting-conspiracy-theories-flying-left-and-right/?mc_cid=361602d524&mc_eid=UNIQID ** Trump shooting conspiracy theories flying left and right (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/trump-shooting-conspiracy-theories-flying-left-and-right/?mc_cid=361602d524&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Katherine M. Fitzgerald In the wake of a recent incident involving Donald Trump, conspiracy theories are proliferating from all sides. These theories range from claims of a coordinated attack to suggestions of a staged event. The flood of speculation highlights the polarized political climate and the propensity for misinformation to spread rapidly in today's media landscape. https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/new-china-algorithm-puts-us-warships-in-clearer-view/?mc_cid=361602d524&mc_eid=UNIQID ** New China algorithm puts US warships in clearer view (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/new-china-algorithm-puts-us-warships-in-clearer-view/?mc_cid=361602d524&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Gabriel Honrada China has developed a new algorithm that significantly enhances the tracking and identification of US warships.

      "Text: Africa Edition - Today's top story: South Africa's new parliament needs to do a better job of holding cabinet to account: legal scholar weighs the chances View in browser https://theconversationafrica.cmail19.com/t/r-e-tdjdutjk-nyuldhjci-jt/ Africa Edition | 17 July 2024 [https://theconversation.com] There’s an air of anticipation – tinged with nervousness – in South Africa ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s opening of parliament tomorrow. This session will see a new set of power dynamics at play as the government of national unity tries to find a foothold now that the African National Congress no longer holds a majority of parliamentary seats. For Hugh Corder the new arrangement offers [https://theconversation.com/south-africas-new-parliament-needs-to-do-a-better-job-of-holding-cabinet-to-account-legal-scholar-weighs-the-chances-234724] an opportunity for MPs to hold members of the executive to account. This has not been a strong point of any of the parliaments this century. This resulted in periods in which the executive ran amok, to the detriment of the country. But he’s cautious: the representatives of the new parties might not behave as well as might be expected. For his part, Francois Venter argues [https://theconversation.com/south-africas-new-unity-government-must-draw-on-the-countrys-greatest-asset-its-constitution-232999] that parliamentarians need first and foremost to acquaint themselves with the country’s 1996 constitution because it’s the country’s greatest asset under the current socioeconomic and political conditions. Then come questions about policy. What policies should emerge from a cabinet that’s made up of ministers from different parties? On education, Thandi Lewin urges [https://theconversation.com/higher-education-faces-many-challenges-in-south-africa-3-priorities-for-the-new-minister-234571] the new minister to focus primarily on three things, including rebuilding the higher education system. When it comes to the environment, Patrick Bond suggests [https://theconversation.com/south-africas-new-environment-minister-must-focus-on-people-not-profits-from-fossil-fuels-climate-ecologist-234301] that the new minister needs to put people ahead of profit in the country’s efforts to achieve a just transition from a carbon-intensive economy. Citizens willingly pay taxes in return for public services such as education and health. That there have been protests against the rising number of taxes in Kenya for two successive years suggests that the unwritten fiscal social contract between the government and the people has broken down. Eric Magale and Mario Schmidt explore [https://theconversation.com/kenya-protests-show-citizens-dont-trust-government-with-their-tax-money-can-ruto-make-a-meaningful-new-deal-234008] ways in which the country can begin to reset these relations.

South Africa’s new unity government must draw on the country’s greatest asset: its constitution [https://theconversation.com/south-africas-new-unity-government-must-draw-on-the-countrys-greatest-asset-its-constitution-232999] Francois Venter, North-West University A sea change in the system of governance is needed to fix South Africa and rebuild an economy plagued by serious crises. Higher education faces many challenges in South Africa: 3 priorities for the new minister [https://theconversation.com/higher-education-faces-many-challenges-in-south-africa-3-priorities-for-the-new-minister-234571] Thandi Lewin, University of Johannesburg In her new position, Nobuhle Nkabane inherits a portfolio rife with challenges. South Africa’s new environment minister must focus on people, not profits from fossil fuels – climate ecologist [https://theconversation.com/south-africas-new-environment-minister-must-focus-on-people-not-profits-from-fossil-fuels-climate-ecologist-234301] Patrick Bond, University of Johannesburg South Africa’s new environment minister has a strong business background, but the country needs a renewable energy champion who’ll also protect communities from fossil fuel corporates. Kenya protests show citizens don’t trust government with their tax money: can Ruto make a meaningful new deal? [https://theconversation.com/kenya-protests-show-citizens-dont-trust-government-with-their-tax-money-can-ruto-make-a-meaningful-new-deal-234008] Eric Magale, University of Pretoria; Mario Schmidt, Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology Citizens willingly pay taxes in return for government using these resources to provide services such as education and health.

      "Text: JD Vance as VP: China focus, less help for Ukraine View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/asiatimes/the-daily-report-hqsb5bnxsv-9608646?e=836d115979) ** July 16, 2024 ------------------------------------------------------------ ** JD Vance as VP: China focus, less help for Ukraine (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/jd-vance-as-vp-china-focus-less-help-for-ukraine/?mc_cid=fae4a89757&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Ava Kalinauskas and Samuel Garrett After months of gamesmanship and speculation, JD Vance has emerged as Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate and the heir apparent to the America First movement. With less than two years in Congress under his belt, the first-term senator from Ohio has very little experience in politics, let alone conducting foreign policy. Yet, Vance’s foreign policy views could prove influential. ** Was there a second shooter? New acoustic evidence (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/was-there-a-second-shooter-new-acoustic-evidence/?mc_cid=fae4a89757&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Stephen Bryen An audio forensic analysis by Catalin Grigoras, director of the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado in Denver, and Cole Whitecotton, a senior professional research associate at Media Forensics, based on audio recorded in Butler, Pennsylvania, may show the possibility of a second shooter present during Trump’s assassination attempt. ** ------------------------------------------------------------ ** Is Bank of Japan finally ready to really raise rates? ------------------------------------------------------------ Subscribe to AT+ Premium (https://asiatimes.com/subscribe-at/?mc_cid=8b250944ca&mc_eid=b9b08c0d21&mc_cid=fae4a89757&mc_eid=UNIQID) to read the latest from William Pesek, who writes that the Bank of Japan might finally raise interest rates after years of maintaining near-zero levels. Speculation grows ahead of the Bank of Japan’s July policy meeting, driven by recent wage increases and economic pressures, potentially impacting global markets. ** Don’t believe Biden or Trump: Tariffs don’t protect jobs (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/dont-believe-biden-or-trump-tariffs-dont-protect-jobs/?mc_cid=fae4a89757&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Richard D Wolff Trump and Biden thus endorsed pro-tariff policies that protected many corporations’ profits. Those policies also appealed to those for whom economic nationalism offered ideological comforts. But instead of safeguarding employment, these trade barriers often lead to higher consumer prices and retaliatory measures from other countries. ** Philippines wants to point more BrahMos missiles at China (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/philippines-wants-to-point-more-brahmos-missiles-at-china/?mc_cid=fae4a89757&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Gabriel Honrada The Philippines is looking to deploy additional BrahMos missiles aimed at deterring Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. This move is part of a broader strategy to bolster its defense capabilities and assert its territorial claims. The increased missile deployment underscores the escalating regional tensions and Manila’s commitment to enhancing its military readiness. ** Kazakhstan seeks great gain, not the Great Game (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/kazakhstan-seeks-great-gain-not-the-great-game/?mc_cid=fae4a89757&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Javier M. Piedra Kazakhstan is focusing on economic development and regional cooperation rather than engaging in geopolitical power struggles. By prioritizing trade, investment, and diplomatic relations, Kazakhstan aims to enhance its economic prosperity and stability. This strategic shift highlights the country's commitment to fostering growth and avoiding entanglement in larger geopolitical conflicts. ** Why are US politicians so darned old? (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/why-are-us-politicians-so-darned-old/?mc_cid=fae4a89757&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Charlie Hunt The advanced age of many US politicians raises questions about the implications for governance and policy-making. Older politicians often dominate key positions, potentially limiting fresh perspectives and innovative solutions. This trend prompts concerns about generational representation and the need for a more diverse and dynamic political landscape to address contemporary challenges. ** Intelligence: The god that failed (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/intelligence-the-god-that-failed/?mc_cid=fae4a89757&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Alexander Casella Ukraine stands out today as the other bookend of intelligence failures. The Russian attack that started on February 24, 2022, took the form of an armored column headed for Kiev. Had the attack occurred 20 years earlier, one can reasonably assume that the Russian force would have reached its target in a matter of hours and imposed on Ukraine a pro-Russian government. ** Second look at India election confirms a sea change (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/second-look-at-india-election-confirms-a-sea-change/?mc_cid=fae4a89757&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Smytta Yadav Narendra Modi was sworn in as India’s prime minister on June 9 for a historic third term. But his power and mandate stand unexpectedly diminished. His Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) fell short of an absolute majority and has had to rely on coalition partners to form the government.

Yet, there isn’t an international treaty specifically outlawing them. Penelope Andrews reflects [https://theconversation.com/gender-apartheid-oppression-of-women-should-be-made-a-crime-against-humanity-feminist-academic-explains-why-234410] on what the UN is doing to expand the definition of crimes against humanity – and why adding a gender lens is important. Chinstrap penguins are highly specialised predators, hunting for marine crustaceans called Antarctic krill. It’s useful to know how much of this food they catch to predict population trends and inform ecosystem management strategies, but it’s hard to observe the birds’ ocean hunting forays. Chris Oosthuizen, Emmanuel Dufourq, Lorène Jeantet, Pierre Pistorius and Stefan Schoombie have found a solution. They explain [https://theconversation.com/diving-with-penguins-tech-gives-ocean-scientists-a-birds-eye-view-of-foraging-in-antarctic-waters-233286] how they trained machine learning algorithms to interpret data about a penguin’s diving movements.

      "Text: Hello friends! We’re joined this week but a whole lot of new readers so I thought I’d let this Mekong update out from under the paywall to celebrate/let everyone get familiar with what our premium subscriptions look like. See you Thursday for our maritime update. Upgrade now and support Dari Mulut ke Mulut (https://darimulut.beehiiv.com/upgrade) Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— ## 🇹🇭 Digital wallets are a go! I might wait for Aug. 1 before I start celebrating Punters can finally start enrolling in the controversial digital wallet program from next month, Bloomberg reports. The Aug. 1 open date comes after Prime Minister Srettha Thaivisin and a panel convened to hatch out the finer details of this tricky plan. “The digital wallet program is a massive state program to inject money into the pockets of people, entrepreneurs and the overall economy. To ensure caution, whether legally or technically, especially regarding security, it has taken a long time. But the people won’t be waiting in vain,” Srettha promised, [as per Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-15/thailand-to-enrol-recipients-of-14-billion-stimulus-next-month). Manufacturing is facing a nightmare with long-established factories — such as a Suzuki plant that churned out up to 60,000 cars a year — closing down as cheaper Chinese imports take over. “The Chinese are now trying to export left, right and centre. Those cheap imports are really causing trouble,” Supavud Saicheua, chairman of the state planning agency National Economic and Social Development Council, [told Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/thai-economy-faces-upheaval-due-factory-closures-cheap-chinese-imports-2024-07-14/). He added that Thai manufacturing is fundamentally broken and it is time for reform. For workers, it’s left many shocked, broke and with few options: “I don't have any savings. I have hundreds of thousands of baht of debt. I'm old, where will I go to work? Who will hire me?” said Chanpen Suetrong, who has worked at the recently closed VMC Safety Glass factory in central Samut Prakan province. Please do not send Y Quynh Bdap back to Vietnam. That’s the message from Thai human rights groups after the co-founder of the Montagnards Stand for Justice group was picked up by police a day after meeting with officials from the Canadian embassy. He has refugee status in Thailand. Vietnam alleges he was involved in last year’s anti-government riots in Dak Lak, a claim he denies. “I am a human rights activist fighting for religious freedom and advocating for people’s rights. My activities are peaceful, consisting only of collecting and writing reports on human rights violations in Vietnam,” he [said in a video provided to the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/thailand-vietnam-activist-extradition-human-rights-groups-68c763df59082a822194fb0473e32eb8) by Thai pro-human rights lawmakers. A court on Monday delayed Bdap’s extradition hearing after it agreed with the defendant’s complaint that there simply had not been enough time to get everything together. “We did not have time to prepare the fight for the case today, which was politically motivated,” lawyer Nadthasiri Bergman told media outside the court, [as per Benar](https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/thai/thailand-vietnam-activist-extradition-07152024045959.html). Hearings will be closed to the public citing national security concerns. ## 🇱🇦 Discontent in the economy, but few options I love nothing more than when the brains at Nikkei Asia turn their attention to the Lao economy. A big, [beautiful one here from Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Laos-central-bank-shake-up-reveals-forex-crisis-China-dependence) this week that looks at movements in the central bank and what they tell us about the state of the economy. Governor Bounleua Sinxayvoravong has walked out after two years — a period that has seen truly staggering inflation numbers, shortages in essentials and a general malaise in employment — but it’s unclear if he’s been forced out, or taking a different role focusing on these structural issues. The reshuffle comes as Laos faces a tough question, is it time to call in the IMF? Vientiane desperately needs cash to service its foreign debts, but foreign exchange reserves are circling the drain. “Laos doesn't want to default on its foreign debts. But it also does not want to go to the IMF for a bailout out because of the political consequences,” one foreign banker who works with Lao clients told the outlet. China and Laos are almost done with a two-week joint military exercise on the outskirts of Vientiane, [Radio Free Asia reports](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/joint-military-exercises-07092024141357.html). A reported 300 Chinese personnel have joined 900 of their Lao counterparts in the exercises. “The Chinese side might have weapons and experiences that can be shared with us. The drill will help strengthen our military ties, organise and modernise our armed forces,” Lt. Col. Santi Chanthalangsone, who leads training for Lao personnel, told the outlet prior to the July 5 launch. We don’t want their hydropower electricity — that’s the message from residents in northern Thailand to their government which is planning to buy electricity generated from Laos’ Pak Beng Hydropower Dam. A petition to the Thai government includes signatures from eight Mekong provinces in Thailand, all of which fear territorial losses and water security issues. This has been a long-running issue along the border — court cases targeting Thai agencies for a perceived lack of action on their behalf have been running since at least 2017. \"[We can't] call the project a clean energy [project] because it is bound to come at the expense of livelihoods, economic well-being and the culture of people living along the Mekong River,” the petition said, [as per the Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2829257/new-hydropower-dam-in-laos-could-lead-to-economic-losses). ## 🇰🇭 Mother Nature activists jailed, Cambodian government flounders response The Cambodian military lost a helicopter in bad weather in the southwest, the Defence Ministry said over the weekend. There hasn’t been much update here and the facts are cagey — the Ministry is keeping mum but Air Force sources [told the AFP](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/cambodia-says-military-helicopter-missing-during-training) that a Chinese-made Z-9 helicopter with at least two people on board was missing. Another beautiful [interactive from the New York Times this week](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/14/world/asia/china-cambodia-military-warship-base.html?unlocked_article_code=1.7E0.2Fhs.GtUqGk06MLd8∣=url-share), where the team has turned its attention to the Ream Military Base in Cambodia. These NYT interactives don’t often have much in the way of new info, but they are fun to read. This one is extra good in that it compares features of the base to similar Chinese-built and backed bases around the world and focuses primarily on expansion and physical construction. The fall-out over the Mother Nature arrests continues. Ten environmental activists linked to the NGO were jailed at the start of the month following July 2021 arrests for ‘plotting against the government’ while campaigning to keep the country’s waterways clean and safe, [BBC reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1340lze6ppo). Three activists, Sun Ratha, Yim Leanghy and Spanish national founder Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, were sentenced to eight years, while the remaining seven were given six-year terms. Gonzalez-Davison and four others were convicted in absentia, while another was not present for sentencing. Only four attended sentencing, [DW reports](https://www.dw.com/en/the-systematic-evisceration-of-cambodian-civil-society/a-69643918). “No one benefits from [it], let alone the government. As we have seen with previous cases like this, this tends to send people into shock for a while, but ultimately backfires because it inspires many others to take [the jailed activists'] place,” Gonzalez-Davidson told the BBC. Cambodia’s Permanent Mission to the UN has rejected comments from UN Human Rights spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan, who called the events “highly prejudicial” against the judiciary and called on the government to reassess the case, [CamboJA reports](https://cambojanews.com/cambodia-rejects-un-human-rights-criticism-of-harsh-penalty-of-mother-nature-activists/). Whatever, says the Permanent Mission. “The environmental activists were charged not because they were exercising their rights and freedom, but for plotting against the government and insulting the King,” it said in a statement. The Mother Nature 10 are set to make appeals, with supporters noting that those that have been jailed have been split up among various provinces making it difficult for family and friends to rally behind them. ## 🇻🇳 Deals! Deals! Deals! (I feel like there are a few neighbours who would be jealous of a list like this) Vietnam is always a lot of business news, but it’s extra this week so let’s crank them out. Indian behemoth Adani is eyeing a port development in the country after securing “in-principle approval from the Vietnamese government,” [Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-13/adani-plans-to-build-port-in-vietnam-to-tap-trade-opportunities). It’s still in the early stage of planning and there is little known about what functions the port would have, exactly, but similar projects in India, Sri Lanka and Tanzania have recently been launched. “The idea is to make India a maritime hub. We are targeting countries that are high on manufacturing or high on population, which will lead to high consumption. We are focusing on export volumes in these countries,” Karan Adani, managing director of Adani Ports and eldest son of founder Gautam, said, as per Bloomberg. Japanese lenders are gassing up Vietnam’s energy sector after the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and private investors pledged US$832 million, [Nikkei Asia reports](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Energy/Vietnam-gas-project-receives-830m-in-Japanese-loans). The financing will go towards the development of gas pipes for Block B gas fields off the southern coast. The expected total cost of the project is around $10 billion. Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast is delaying the opening of its huge $4 billion plant in the United States ‘amid global uncertainties in the EV market,’ [Reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vietnams-vinfast-delays-us-electric-car-plant-amid-market-slowdown-2024-07-13/). It has revised its 100,000 EV production target this year down to 80,000 despite a bump in Q2 sales: “While the second-quarter delivery results were encouraging, ongoing economic headwinds and uncertainties in different macro-economies and (the) global EV landscape necessitate a more prudent outlook for the rest of the year,” the company said in a statement. Elsewhere, at least 11 people have been confirmed dead in a terrible landslide in the northern province of Ha Giang, [China Daily reports](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/14/WS6692d429a31095c51c50de7d.html) citing Vietnamese news sources. And African Swine Fever is back, with authorities concerned this outbreak could rival the deeply destabilising outbreaks in 2018 and 2019. “The risk of wider spread of the disease is very high, and it can affect food supplies, consumer prices and the environment,” local authorities said in a statement last week. ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://latinamericadailybriefing.substack.com/p/latin-america-responds-to-trump-assassination At a campaign rally on Saturday afternoon, a lone gunman opened fire, hitting former president and current presidential candidate Donald Trump in the ear and raising important security concerns.

Martín Schapiro at Cenital [ https://substack.com/redirect/9171f1a5-c111-4bde-be05-118f462c4efd?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] mentions a few of the various recent acts of political violence in the U.S., including Gabby Giffords, Steve Scalise, and Paul Pelosi, and notes that ever-growing extreme partisanship is making this kind of political violence more and more expected in the country. Argentina wins Copa América amid security failures Argentina beat Colombia 1-0 last night at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami in a thrilling final to become the most decorated national team in Latin America, boasting 16 Copa América titles. Argentina’s Lautaro Martinez scored the game’s only goal in overtime, handing a final victory to Angel Di María, who had announced the Copa América would be his final tournament with the albiceleste. It was also likely one of the final games with Argentina for captain Lionel Messi, who left the pitch in tears with an ankle injury. From a security standpoint, however, the match offered more questions than answers. The combination of fans attempting to enter the stadium without tickets, a lack of security preparations regarding entry to the stadium, and extreme heat resulted in chaos and an 82-minute delay to the start of the match (Buenos Aires Times [ https://substack.com/redirect/97f47b31-bbb2-4496-9da6-e7fee5a4b1c2?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]).

The events called into question U.S. preparedness as the next host of the 2026 World Cup (alongside Mexico and Canada), where 48 teams will come to the northern hemisphere to compete. Fans and pundits were quick to place blame for the chaos, with many pointing to the organization - or lack thereof - by the CONMEBOL, soccer’s governing body in South America, says Forbes [ https://substack.com/redirect/513c2a44-c144-46ab-a6fd-23188ff77327?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Though these incidents were the most visible, they joined other organizational issues earlier in the tournament, including clashes between the Uruguayan team and Colombian fans, as well as lack of medical attention or preparedness for referees and fans (Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/81394240-ac13-4ea9-aeca-77eb7f41cedf?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]). Others also blamed CONCACAF (CONMEBOL’s northern counterpart) and the United States, who as hosts were responsible for overseeing the terms laid out by CONMEBOL and for the overall organization of the tournament, and criticized their profound misunderstanding of Latin American soccer culture. Though ultimately the event was able to continue and the worst outcomes were avoided, scenes from outside the stadium served as a wake-up call for the organizers of the World Cup in 2 years’ time, and the Club World Cup next year. Peru Alberto Fujimori, former president of Perú, will seek his third term as president in the 2026 elections despite his failing health and his numerous critical convictions, reports MercoPress [ https://substack.com/redirect/4af8069a-56bc-4692-bee8-255ca8af5e6a?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. His daughter Keiko, a former presidential candidate herself, will not be part of his ticket. Venezuela Edmundo González Urrutia, the chosen candidate of Venezuela’s opposition following the banning of their two previous choices, is leading in the polls. He wants to build “a country of prosperity, democracy, and peace” if he is elected, notes the Guardian [ https://substack.com/redirect/8f581ab1-1d62-4549-9f75-58225879376e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ].

The government is attempting to “tilt the playing field,” argues Tamara Taraciuk Broner, while Michael Shifter believes that “The talks are unlikely to have much impact in the short term.” The uncertainty of the outcome of Venezuela’s upcoming elections does not translate into an automatic loss for Maduro, writes Joshua Collins for Pirate Wire Services [ https://substack.com/redirect/19c2abbe-1e92-442b-8826-77ff93307e21?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], believing Maduro will not just step aside in the event of an opposition victory.

Amid a sharp need for additional hard currency, Milei might find himself reverting to policies he has criticized the “caste” for implementing, including another devaluation or a new deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The Russian attack that started on February 24, 2022, took the form of an armored column headed for Kiev. Had the attack occurred 20 years earlier, one can reasonably assume that the Russian force would have reached its target in a matter of hours and imposed on Ukraine a pro-Russian government. ** Second look at India election confirms a sea change (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/second-look-at-india-election-confirms-a-sea-change/?mc_cid=abd38f424e&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Smytta Yadav Narendra Modi was sworn in as India’s prime minister on June 9 for a historic third term. But his power and mandate stand unexpectedly diminished. His Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) fell short of an absolute majority and has had to rely on coalition partners to form the government. A closer examination of India's recent election reveals a significant shift in the political landscape. ** ------------------------------------------------------------ ** Is Bank of Japan finally ready to really raise rates? ------------------------------------------------------------ Subscribe to AT+ Premium (https://asiatimes.com/subscribe-at/?mc_cid=8b250944ca&mc_eid=b9b08c0d21&mc_cid=abd38f424e&mc_eid=UNIQID) to read the latest from William Pesek, who writes that the Bank of Japan might finally raise interest rates after years of maintaining near-zero levels. Speculation grows ahead of the Bank of Japan’s July policy meeting, driven by recent wage increases and economic pressures, potentially impacting global markets. ** Violence may be a determining factor for US election (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/violence-may-be-a-determining-factor-for-us-election/?mc_cid=abd38f424e&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Jack L. Rozdilsky Recent studies on attitudes toward political violence indicate that a small but not insignificant number of Americans support the idea of using violence to advance political ideas. While Donald Trump has been the victim of a heinous attempted assassination, it’s difficult to ignore how he has catalyzed extreme political polarization by tacitly supporting political violence. ** Biden’s senility, and ours (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/bidens-senility-and-ours/?mc_cid=abd38f424e&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Spengler We have met senility, and he is us. It isn’t just poor Joe Biden who has aged ungracefully. The wealthy nations of the world are aging and the consequences will be far more painful than the passing humiliation of one Western leader. Instead of cringing at the president’s agonizing attempts to prove his mental competence, we should look hard in the mirror. ** South Korea aims laser arms at North Korea’s drones (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/south-korea-aims-laser-arms-at-north-koreas-drones/?mc_cid=abd38f424e&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Gabriel Honrada South Korea is developing laser weapons to counter the threat of North Korean drones. These advanced defense systems are designed to detect and neutralize unmanned aerial vehicles, enhancing South Korea's security capabilities. This underscores Seoul's commitment to protecting its airspace against potential incursions amid a technological arms race on the Korean Peninsula. ** One inch from a potential civil war (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/one-inch-from-a-potential-civil-war/?mc_cid=abd38f424e&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Arlie Perliger If, indeed, Donald Trump had suffered fatal injuries during his attempted assassination, the level of violence that we witnessed so far would be nothing in comparison to what would have happened in the next couple of months.

Goldman China’s June exports rose 8.6% year-on-year in US dollar terms and 10.7% in RMB, exceeding analysts’ expectations and pointing to higher-than-expected GDP growth for the second quarter.

New study offers an answer View in browser https://theconversationafrica.cmail19.com/t/r-e-tdjiujtl-nyuldhjci-jl/ Africa Edition | 15 July 2024 [https://theconversation.com] A fossil discovery in Taung, South Africa 100 years ago changed how scientists thought about human evolution. It was followed by a number of important fossil discoveries in the area dubbed the “cradle of humankind”. These finds sparked a debate that rages on today: exactly how old are South Africa’s Australopithecus africanus fossils? Francis Thackeray explains [https://theconversation.com/how-old-are-south-african-fossils-like-the-taung-child-new-study-offers-an-answer-234088] how studying the fossilised teeth of hominins (ancient human ancestors) may have provided an answer. Tanzanians will vote in local elections this year, followed by a general election next year. These elections are significant. They follow a series of reforms introduced over the last three years under President Samia Suluhu Hassan to widen the democratic space in the east African country. A ban on opposition rallies was lifted last year and new electoral laws have been passed to make the political process fairer. However, Aikande Clement Kwayu notes [https://theconversation.com/tanzanias-election-laws-make-it-hard-to-build-political-opposition-what-needs-to-change-233995] that real structural change has yet to happen – and explains what still needs to be done.

      "Text: Hello friends! On the road from Canberra to Sydney, there is an enormous lake that is often devoid of water and perfect for staring out over while listening to sad music in a perfect movie scene. Bus drivers used to love to say that when Lake George was empty, a lake in China was full. And when that Chinese lake was empty, George was full. Doesn’t really make sense to me, academically, but vibes feel right, somehow. That’s how I feel about Malaysia and Thailand. When Thailand is on the verge of political chaos, Malaysia relaxes. When Malaysia is gearing up, Thailand takes a break. This week in Bangkok is a rare break — last week the Senate election was (largely) completed and the second round of hearings into Prime Minister Srettha Thaivisin’s future and that of the Move Forward won’t be back in court until next week. So, take a seat Thailand. Let Malaysia have this week. A nervous Anwar Ibrahim is eyeing the parties as movements within Bersatu has analysts asking the question every dilettante fears: is this a constitutional crisis in the making? But first — Alice Guo. This weekly newsletter is free for all readers and supported by premium subscribers. If you’d like to join them for deeper coverage of the region, we’d love to have you! Support Dari Mulut ke Mulut (https://darimulut.beehiiv.com/upgrade) Erin Cook PS I think this week’s episode of Reformasi with Kevin O’Rourke is extra good! We chatted with Nenden Sekar Arum at SAFEnet, an Indonesian group advocating for digital rights and cyber-safety. We began with the big data hack story but Nenden was very generous and let us pepper her with all sorts of tech/digital/online questions! Ransomware or Randomware? Indonesia's Bizarre National Data Hack (with Nenden Sekar Arum): (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qlcLEq3mBw5Z0JA9b599z?si=9b26e086129c46eb&nd=1&dlsi=c66393e72b6a4bff) ——————————————————————————— ## 🇵🇭 Alice Guo is gone — once authorities can find her Arrest suspended Bamban mayor, Alice Guo. That’s the order from the Senate on Saturday after the embattled politico “unduly [refused] to appear, despite due notices,” to a Senate probe into Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators last week, [Rappler reports](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/senate-orders-arrest-mayor-alice-guo-july-2024/#:~:text=MANILA%2C%20Philippines%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Senate%20has,Offshore%20Gaming%20Operator%20(POGOs).). It comes after the Court of Appeals [granted a petition](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/court-appeals-freezes-bamban-mayor-alice-guo-assets/) from the Anti-Money Laundering Council to freeze her assets on Thursday. Acquaintances and family are also named in warrants. Guo’s former accountant Nancy Gamo was nabbed Saturday afternoon and could be held by the Senate for as long as the POGO probe takes, [Rappler notes](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/mayor-alice-guo-ex-accountant-arrested-under-senate-custody/). Sen. Risa Hontiveros, who is a leading senate critic of POGOs and who catapulted Guo to national infamy with her questioning of Guo’s biographical details, has called on Guo to turn herself in, saying dodging authorities isn’t really helping her case. Hontiveros, of course, gave Guo a public pummelling for the ages back in May when she disputed much of Guo’s life story, including finding that Guo may not be a Filipino national at all and instead a Chinese national. This came after a March raid on offices partially owned by Guo, raising questions initially about the providence of Guo’s money and business interests and, eventually, the providence of Guo herself. The key for now, however, is that Guo is alleged to be deeply involved in POGOs, a notoriously shady industry in which companies based in the Philippines operate online gambling sites targeting those abroad. Hontiveros and a hell of a lot of Filipinos aren’t enormous fans of the industry and this senate inquiry is aimed at shining some light on what exactly is going on with them. Guo is scared to front up to the Senate, her lawyers say. She’s been the victim of [intimidation and death threats](https://globalnation.inquirer.net/242068/guo-receiving-death-threats) and is suffering unidentified health issues that are exacerbating trauma, lawyer [Stephen David said in comments published by PhilStar last week](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2024/07/09/2368899/no-fair-hearing-expected-senate-inquiry-mayor-guos-camp) that, on review now, kinda make it clear she was going to dodge. For Hontiveros, “the issuance of the arrest order is only the first step to making Mayor Alice Guo or Guo Hua Ping accountable to our laws,” she said in a statement Saturday, [as per the Inquirer](https://globalnation.inquirer.net/242452/hontiveros-arrest-order-vs-alice-guo-others-for-protection-of-filipinos). “Of all the lies and possible crimes of Mayor Alice and all involved in POGO, this is not merely procedural. This arrest order upholds the mandate of the Senate to safeguard the well-being of Filipinos.” This week I’ll be glued to the Inquirer and Rappler for updates. ## 🇻🇳 It won’t go dark in Vietnam, government promises Northern Vietnam is ready and waiting for heatwaves to hit the area and for the electronic hub, home to factories for Apple and Samsung, electricity stability is crucial. Vietnam Electricity Group says it expects peak demand to hit more than 27,000 megawatts this month. Northern Vietnam copped blackouts last year during the same period, in part due to malfunctions at coal-fired plants, [Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/vietnam-vows-to-keep-lights-on-in-electronics-hub-as-needs-soar). Stay cool, everyone. ## 🇮🇩 Indonesia to claw back data After last month’s cataclysmic hack on a national data centre, Indonesian authorities say they’re now in the process of getting back data. More than 160 government agencies were affected by the ransomware attack, in which Brain Cipher demanded US$8 million to hand it back over — though they then apologised and released a decryption key. The whole thing is still very strange to me, listen to last week’s Reformasi for more. “The communications ministry is using a decryption strategy to recover services or assets from ministries, state agencies, and the regional governments that are affected. We are handling this gradually,” Chief Security Minister Hadi Tjahjanto said in a statement, [as per Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/indonesia-says-it-has-begun-recovering-data-after-major-ransomware-attack-2024-07-12/). ## 🇲🇾 Political intrigue in Malaysia is back After a few months of [poor by-election results](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/minority-voters-no-longer-a-sure-prop-for-malaysia-s-pm-anwar-after-low-turnout-in-penang-by-election) for the Anwar Ibrahim government, intrigue is back in Malaysia. It may well be the base state of Malaysia in the post-Najib years, but, despite some major hiccups in recent months, things have been relatively solid. But holy smokes are we back! Last week, Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Johari Abdul declared six Bersatu MPs could hold onto their seats despite being booted from the party. This particular calamity — at least from former PM and Bersatu boss Muhyddin Yassin’s perspective — has reignited the party-hopping legislation, which was passed back in 2022 in an effort to stem the tide of MPs jumping all over the place in an endless permutation of coalitions. Article 49A of the law states an MP will lose their office if they ‘resign’ or ‘cease to be’ a member of their party but, [according to the Malay Mail](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/07/11/what-we-know-so-far-fate-of-the-six-rogue-ex-bersatu-mps/143296), it also states that if an MP is purged from the party they can keep their seat. Bersatu, aware of this loophole, didn’t purge the members but rather rewrote party rules to ‘ceasing’ membership. Good try but no go, said the Speaker. While Muhyiddin stews and plots, commentators and analysts worry about where this is going to go next. If other parties change their constitutions to dodge Article 49A, could Malaysia be looking at a constitutional crisis? Pakatan Harapan’s comms director Fahmi Fadzil has played down questions that the government is nervous about what six by-elections would mean if the MPs were booted in the end. “This is not a matter of being afraid or not afraid [of elections]. This is about the constitution,” he told media, [as reported by Bernama](https://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=2317306). This is going to take a long time to shake out, I bet, but I’d still wager we’ve got a busy week of statements and hot takes ahead. ### Interesting reads [Thai banks admit lack of capacity to investigate Myanmar weapon payments](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-banks-admit-lack-capacity-investigate-myanmar-weapon-payments-2024-07-11/) (Reuters) Major Thai banks defended themselves on Thursday against criticism that they facilitated weapons purchases by the Myanmar junta, saying they lacked the capacity to investigate all transactions that may be used for such purchases. Representatives of the lenders told a parliamentary committee, however, that they strictly followed existing regulations. [Pattaya residents protest 'sin city' label](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2828133/pattaya-residents-protest-sin-city-label) (Bangkok Post) Residents in Pattaya have protested against the label \"sin city, heaven of prostitutes\" used by the Thai media outlet Thairath, demanding that the city's positive aspects be highlighted. Entrepreneurs and locals gathered at the entrance of the Pattaya Walking Street on Thursday night to protect the city's dignity and reputation. The entrepreneurs insisted that Pattaya is not solely defined by its entertainment industry but boasts diverse attractions that draw tourists worldwide. They also highlighted the contribution of Pattaya's travel business to Thailand's economic growth. [Singapore hawkers highlight generational challenge to famed culinary traditions](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Tea-Leaves/Singapore-hawkers-highlight-generational-challenge-to-famed-culinary-traditions2) (Nikkei Asia) Tan's death is not the only recent loss for Singapore's famed hawker culture, which was inscribed in 2020 on UNESCO's list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. In March, Song Yancheng, of Hock Kee Fried Kway Teow, also died. His specialty was a wok-fried flat noodle dish featuring cockles, eggs and a distinctive smoky aroma. Song's children subsequently closed the family food stall. The deaths of the two noodle masters — and tales of other hawkers retiring without successors — have spurred a round of soul-searching in Singapore about its street food heritage. Will the time-honoured culture of hawker centres, food courts and community dining face extinction as a generation of cooks ends its time in the trade? ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://evanellis.substack.com/p/evan-ellis-engagement-with-china Dear Colleague, Today, the grave news of the assassination attempt against U.S. President and Presidential Candidate Donald Trump reminds us that the U.S. is bound with our partners in the Western Hemisphere, and in the world beyond, in the struggle to preserve democracy, in the many ways that it can come under threat. In this spirit, I would like to share with you my new work on the complex impact that commercial, political, and other engagement with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has had on democracy in the countries of Latin America, to which U.S. security and prosperity is bound by ties of geography, commerce and family. By contrast to the Soviet Union, which fought during the Cold War to undermine democracies through military and political subversion, this work examines the more indirect, but equally grave threats presented to the region through: (1) the influence of Chinese “training programs” for Latin American journalists, police, government officials and others in the region; (2) the subversive example off PRC privileging of the State over democratic voice and protection of the individual in its governance model and technology solutions, and: (3) the impact of Chinese commercial and other “no questions asked” (as long as Chinese companies are protected) support as an “incubator” of authoritarianism, helping populist governments to survive as they consolidate power and dismantle legal constraints and protections within their own societies.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://www.piratewireservices.com/p/elections-in-venezuela-are-a-genuine Venezuela holds presidential elections on July 28. Opposition rallies across the country are packed, even in former Chavista strongholds, despite government attempts to make them as difficult as possible, such as arresting campaign workers [ https://substack.com/redirect/27b8de99-e49f-4013-afd7-650ce5419809?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], fining restaurants and hotels who provide services to candidates or their staff, and even closing roads [ https://substack.com/redirect/eb950abe-d523-4cc6-9f8c-dd622b0b6f57?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] to make the events as difficult as possible. The airwaves are saturated with ads supporting the Maduro government, and the only mention of opposition candidates across the country are the President's attacks on them— claims they are undermining the “Bolivarian Revolution”, the leftist political revolution of Hugo Chávez that Maduro claims to represent. But despite the obstacles, many within Venezuela are beginning to feel a sensation that they have not felt in years— that a real possibility for change may be just around the corner. Polling is notoriously unreliable in Venezuela, due to unethical polling companies that often serve more as arms of political campaigns than neutral organizations, as well as self-censorship of voters themselves who may be reluctant to be honest about their political opinions in a country that has long oppressed or imprisoned dissidents— especially after a new “Anti-Hate Law [ https://substack.com/redirect/4413479f-6ae6-4333-bcb5-02d09a83689c?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]” was passed in 2017 that allows for prison sentences of up to 20 years for those who speak out against the government [ https://substack.com/redirect/0610f090-7d7c-4c1a-b04b-f4553ec57de2?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. But some polls show the current opposition presidential candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia. 30 to 50 points ahead of Maduro [ https://substack.com/redirect/573c4660-76ea-4f4b-96f5-96a116b97c02?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], despite the fact that before the current elections, few Venezuelans knew who has was— an expression of the amount of support Maduro has lost since the country was plunged into an economic and political crisis which resulted in nearly 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country since 2014. Even some of Maduro’s former political allies, such as the Venezuelan Communist Party, have also withdrawn their support and publicly announced they would back another candidate [ https://substack.com/redirect/339cd6b2-1e06-462a-af51-a5c36713f2af?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Urrutia took over the campaign after the two previous candidates were disqualified from running by the government. Right-wing candidate Maria Corina Machado won the opposition’s primary in October 2023 with 93% of the vote [ https://substack.com/redirect/42fec399-865f-4e17-8d3d-20f76a3202e8?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] but was banned from running. As was her appointed successor Corina Yoris. She has since thrown her support [ https://substack.com/redirect/b5950470-9090-451c-bf18-c16498e60dcf?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] fully behind González, holding rallies across the country calling for an end to the Maduro government. Maduro, who took power after the death of Chávez in 2013, has held power for a decade and is seeking another 6-year term as president. Previous elections in the country were plagued with irregularities, and criticized by both the European Union and the Organization of American States in Latin America.

Current elections were organized in response to the “Barbados Agreement [ https://substack.com/redirect/8fb798a5-5539-4d34-b9f9-7a22dee4a2bc?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]”, which occurred in October 2023, between Maduro’s government and the opposition and mediated by representatives from Norway. Among other points, the accord stipulated that new Presidential elections would be organized by late 2024, and would include election observers from the European Union. Although the United States was not a direct party to the negotiations, they scaled back some oil sanctions on Venezuela as an incentive to stick to the agreement. Venezuela has since uninvited EU election observers as well as broken promises not to arrest members of opposition political parties. It is impossible to predict what will happen after the elections, but in the case of an opposition victory, it is quite possible that Maduro will refuse to step down— and his administration has a host of tools at its disposal to avoid doing so. “I think the administration of Maduro is facing a tough choice,” Tony Frangie Mawad, a journalist in Caracas told PWS. “They could choose to impose a full transition from an autocracy to a Nicaragua-style dictatorship crackdown,” to prevent a loss. Or “they could try further indirect election influence, or even canceling the elections,” he continued. Ultimately though, Mawad doesn’t believe Maduro is likely to simply step aside. Some analysts have suggested that unprecedented support could strongly weaken his support among allies, or inspire widespread protests in the streets. But Maduro has been underestimated by political analysts, both domestic and international, before. Some Venezuelans have described their feelings [ https://substack.com/redirect/9bfb43b4-1285-4967-9ee9-d726bc3fdf6c?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] about the elections as “a see-saw between hope and fear”. Leftist leaders in the country have also pressured Maduro to respect election results. President Lula, in Brazil, has on multiple occasions called on the Venezuelan government to fulfill their obligations under the Barbados Agreement. Petro, in Colombia, has announced that the country will not send election observers for a host of reasons, among them that Colombia “does not want to give the appearance of legitimizing elections.” In the same statement, Colombia repeated previous calls for the U.S. to end sanctions against Venezuela. Boric, in Chile, has often criticized Venezuela’s human rights record and called for truly free elections in the country. Both the United Nations and Human Rights Watch have criticized increasingly authoritarian crackdowns [ https://substack.com/redirect/7ae07541-02cf-4b6b-a8ee-d40d0b32f0be?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] by the Venezuelan government ahead of elections. Meanwhile, the Maduro campaign has swung into full action. Members of his party are organizing voter organization drives, pledging to ensure that every member will ensure that at least 10 friends and relatives likely to vote for Maduro make it to the polls. The government has also staged rallies in Caracas, and invited journalists and influencers sympathetic to the government to come to the country ahead of elections, which he has framed as a defense of the Bolivarian Revolution and a “struggle against Imperialism”. Meanwhile, most of those Venezuelans living abroad will be excluded from casting a ballot, both due to onerous restrictions about foreign residents voting, and a lack of government infrastructure where the majority of them live. Venezuelan embassies in the United States and Colombia were closed years ago, leaving many in the diaspora disenfranchised. Nonetheless, some of them are hopeful. Javier Guerrero, a Venezuelan artist in Medellin, when asked about his feelings on elections, replied “I don’t know what is going to happen. But this is the first time I’ve seen some Colectivos (social organizations created by Chávez, some of which act as informal militia), abandoning him.” “This is the first time I see doubt from some of his traditional supporters,” he continued. Guerrero, however, stopped short of predicting an outcome. “Venezuela has proven over and over that it is anything but predictable. I just hope that if Maduro does finally leave office, something I personally hope to see in my lifetime, that we don’t just swing immediately to the far-right in a reactionary manner as a result.” The Big Headlines in LATAM As of Saturday evening, even Latin American news sites were dominated by the news of the assassination attempt of U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump. The fledgling democracy, which in recent years has been plagued by political instability and coup attempts, suffered another blow as one of its two octogenarian candidates from the elite upper classes was wounded when a shooter fired at him during a campaign event. Most political analysts from the capital, called Washington D.C., were quick to call for an end to violence. Some international observers, however, questioned whether events such as this may be “the new normal.” Many leaders from more civilized countries, in Latin America, offered messages of support for the ex-reality T.V. star turned ex-president, and condemned the assassination attempt. There was no immediate news on whether a U.N-led peacekeeping mission would be deployed until order can be restored. Ha! Sorry, we’re being a bit tongue-in-cheek here. We thought it might be funny to cover U.S. events in the tone many international media companies cover our own beats here in LATAM. In other news, Colombia squares off against Argentina today in the semi-finals of the American Cup. This, sadly, pits PWS members against PWS members. But we promise to be civilized about it no matter who wins. Spanish Word of the Week Enchufados An enchufado, in Venezuelan slang, is someone who has an enchufe, a source of power. The simplest translation to English might be “someone who is plugged in”. Corruption in Venezuela is endemic. Transparency International rates it at 177th out of 180 countries in the world [ https://substack.com/redirect/87a93eb7-3dea-4f98-a44a-aafd05046301?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Those who benefit from that corruption, or their family members, are often called enchufados. An entire Enchufado culture has emerged in Caracas in recent years, with young influencers with powerful family members posting images of their lavish lifestyles [ https://substack.com/redirect/b26acfe1-2253-4a6a-a98f-f07a2c20af9c?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] on social media, and driving demand for luxury goods, even as millions suffer from extreme economic crisis. No matter what happens in the upcoming Venezuelan elections, the Enchufados are unlikely to fade from power anytime soon. Corruption is historically extremely resilient to regime-change.

Besides this unusually long distance, the lions also had to contend with hippos and crocodiles, which are known to attack the big cats. Alexander Richard Braczkowski, Christopher J. O'Bryan, Duan Biggs and Robynne Kotze explain [https://theconversation.com/lions-in-a-uganda-park-make-a-perilous-journey-across-a-1-5km-stretch-of-water-study-suggests-the-drive-is-to-find-mates-233807]that the swim wasn’t just a remarkable show of strength. It was also a symptom of a deeper problem: male lions having to take extraordinary risks to find lionesses. Vulindlela was a 1997 song by Brenda Fassie, South African pop star, national sweetheart and bad girl. It marked a comeback for Fassie, rocketing her to the top of the charts with a wedding theme that also celebrated the mood of a newly democratic South Africa. Mbali Mazibuko argues [https://theconversation.com/brenda-fassies-1997-hit-song-vulindlela-still-raises-questions-about-south-africa-as-a-nation-230477]the song holds greater political significance today than a listener might think.

      "Text: China and Japan ignite Asian hypersonic arms race View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/asiatimes/the-daily-report-hqsb5bnxsv-9608634?e=836d115979) ** July 12, 2024 ------------------------------------------------------------ ** China and Japan ignite Asian hypersonic arms race (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/china-and-japan-ignite-asian-hypersonic-arms-race/?mc_cid=6e4d2faa3b&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Gabriel Honrada China and Japan are fueling a hypersonic arms race in Asia with significant investments in advanced missile technology. Both nations are developing hypersonic weapons to enhance their military capabilities, raising regional security concerns and prompting other countries to consider similar advancements in a potential new East Asian arms race. ** US slaps ‘symbolic’ tariffs on China steel, aluminum (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/us-slaps-symbolic-tariffs-on-china-steel-aluminum/?mc_cid=6e4d2faa3b&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Jeff Pao The United States has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum products originating from China via Mexico, closing a loophole that had allowed Chinese metal suppliers to evade US tariffs since 2018. Although these tariffs may not heavily impact China's economy, the move highlights the US's resolve to address trade issues and keep the pressure on China amidst broader geopolitical disputes. ** ------------------------------------------------------------ ** Is Bank of Japan finally ready to really raise rates? ------------------------------------------------------------ Subscribe to AT+ Premium (https://asiatimes.com/subscribe-at/?mc_cid=8b250944ca&mc_eid=b9b08c0d21&mc_cid=6e4d2faa3b&mc_eid=UNIQID) to read the latest from William Pesek, who writes that the Bank of Japan might finally raise interest rates after years of maintaining near-zero levels. Speculation grows ahead of the Bank of Japan’s July policy meeting, driven by recent wage increases and economic pressures, potentially impacting global markets. ** Yellen’s de-dollarization fears will only get worse (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/yellens-de-dollarization-fears-will-only-get-worse/?mc_cid=6e4d2faa3b&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By William Pesek In the middle of an otherwise mundane Congressional hearing on July 9, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made an extraordinary admission: De-dollarization is now her biggest fear. Though it might sound obvious to many, it’s a stark about-face for a US economy czar who’s long denied the dollar is in danger of losing its status as the dominant reserve currency. ** NATO de facto fueling Indo-Pacific’s re-militarization (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/nato-de-facto-fueling-indo-pacifics-re-militarization/?mc_cid=6e4d2faa3b&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Bob Savic and Michael Lloyd The Indo-Pacific is being rapidly re-militarized as bilateral defense agreements spring up across much of the region. This is happening in the context of intensifying great power rivalry between the US, its NATO allies and Western-oriented regional partners jostling for control and influence against the rising powers of China, Russia and other regional states. ** 3rd Plenum will treat economy with Chinese medicine (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/3rd-plenum-will-treat-economy-with-chinese-medicine/?mc_cid=6e4d2faa3b&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Alicia Garcia Herrero China's upcoming 3rd Plenum aims to address economic challenges using traditional Chinese medicine principles. This approach focuses on long-term health and balance rather than short-term fixes. The leadership is expected to implement measures that promote sustainable growth, reduce financial risks, and enhance economic stability. ** Make way for imperial NATO with new flanks to secure (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/make-way-for-imperial-nato-with-new-flanks-to-secure/?mc_cid=6e4d2faa3b&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Stephen Bryen and Shoshana Bryen NATO is expanding its strategic reach, securing new flanks in response to evolving global threats. This \"imperial\" NATO approach involves bolstering defenses and extending influence into regions like the Indo-Pacific and the Arctic. While NATO is floating plans for enlargement of its membership and its capabilities, democratic friends in the Pacific are looking for a NATO umbrella. ** China redefining air power with huge stealth fighter rollout (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/china-redefining-air-power-with-huge-stealth-fighter-rollout/?mc_cid=6e4d2faa3b&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Gabriel Honrada China is revolutionizing its air power with the massive deployment of stealth fighters. This significant expansion of advanced aircraft capabilities enhances Beijing's military strength and regional influence. The rollout showcases China's commitment to developing cutting-edge technology and achieving air superiority, challenging the traditional dominance of Western air forces. ** NATO summit matched by rise of rival SCO (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/nato-summit-matched-by-rise-of-rival-sco/?mc_cid=6e4d2faa3b&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Stefan Wolff As NATO holds its summit, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is emerging as a formidable rival. The SCO's increasing influence and expanding membership highlight its growing significance in global geopolitics.

He has hardly any competition given the expulsion of opposition candidates and the silencing of critics. Despite a win being all but certain, AI-powered accounts have been flooding discussions of the upcoming poll, praising Kagame’s candidacy and stifling critical posts. Morgan Wack explains [https://theconversation.com/ai-propaganda-campaign-in-rwanda-has-been-pushing-pro-kagame-messages-a-dangerous-new-trend-in-africa-234296] how these accounts are manipulating perceptions and spreading propaganda.

Brenda Fassie is still a loved and controversial figure in South Africa even 20 years after her death.

In particular, the bill proposes merging five different taxes into one “value-added tax (VAT),” with different rates at the national and regional levels. A maximum rate of 26.5% was established for the overall consumption tax. The bill also proposes “a tax on products considered harmful to the environment or human health, like cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.” (Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/fe6be7c6-f7fd-446e-b77a-7ce36bbeb72b?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Various industries are concerned about tax increases and levies, including the infrastructure and mining industries, and those in the water and sanitation sector, explained BN Americas [ https://substack.com/redirect/5fd8ac4b-2ea1-443b-876d-48625c1b3527?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ].

This \"imperial\" NATO approach involves bolstering defenses and extending influence into regions like the Indo-Pacific and the Arctic. While NATO is floating plans for enlargement of its membership and its capabilities, democratic friends in the Pacific are looking for a NATO umbrella. ** China redefining air power with huge stealth fighter rollout (https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/china-redefining-air-power-with-huge-stealth-fighter-rollout/?mc_cid=995684d803&mc_eid=UNIQID) ------------------------------------------------------------ By Gabriel Honrada China is revolutionizing its air power with the massive deployment of stealth fighters. This significant expansion of advanced aircraft capabilities enhances Beijing's military strength and regional influence. The rollout showcases China's commitment to developing cutting-edge technology and achieving air superiority, challenging the traditional dominance of Western air forces. ** ------------------------------------------------------------ ** Is Bank of Japan finally ready to really raise rates? ------------------------------------------------------------ Subscribe to AT+ Premium (https://asiatimes.com/subscribe-at/?mc_cid=8b250944ca&mc_eid=b9b08c0d21&mc_cid=995684d803&mc_eid=UNIQID) to read the latest from William Pesek, who writes that the Bank of Japan might finally raise interest rates after years of maintaining near-zero levels.

      "Text: Hello friends! A few weeks ago I split the Myanmar newsletter into two with a focus on Myanmar from the inside and then Myanmar from the outside. I really liked how that worked out so I’m going to stick with that — and good timing too since we have a lot of China to get through. Myanmar newsletters will stay free for all readers for as long as they have to, and that’s very much thanks to premium readers whose subscriptions make that possible. If you’d like to join that list please do so here: Upgrade to support Dari Mulut ke Mulut (https://darimulut.beehiiv.com/upgrade) See you for part two next week, Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/04f3210b-0123-4e31-a86d-c7a0b4bac98c/zuyet-awarmatik-dEnHBDTzo0A-unsplash.jpg?t=1720655134) Caption: Photo by [Zuyet Awarmatik](https://unsplash.com/@zuyetawarmatik?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/people-walking-on-street-during-daytime-dEnHBDTzo0A?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) ## 🇹🇭 UN’s Tom Andrews takes aim at banking Singapore is out and Thailand is in as the State Administration Council’s preferred destination for banking, a report from UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, found last month. The report found international sanctions have slowed down the junta’s ability to move money around and buy arms — a claim the junta has long downplayed, [Reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-junta-still-able-access-weapons-money-overseas-says-un-expert-2024-06-26/). Singaporean business ties to the junta were an immediate focus for the people’s resistance movement in the early days of the coup which aimed to pile pressure on private companies to step back. Last year, following a similar report from the UN, the government launched an investigation that eventually saw a crackdown and a major reduction in military exports to Myanmar, [Nikkei Asia reports](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Crisis/Myanmar-military-shifts-arms-financing-to-Thai-banks-from-Singapore). This most recent report hopes it will exert the same pressure on Bangkok. “If the government of Thailand were to respond to this information as the government of Singapore did one year ago, the SAC's ability to attack the people of Myanmar would be significantly impaired,” the report noted. Interestingly, banks and governments elsewhere were largely responsive to enquiries but Thailand was a notable unreturned call. Nikkei Asia reports both the enormous Siam Commercial Bank and the Thai government itself were not interested in participating. Looking more broadly at [Thai-Myanmar relations for Fulcrum](https://fulcrum.sg/neighbour-to-civil-war-thailands-relations-with-myanmar-in-2024/), Paul Chambers and Kridsana Chotisut write that the economic futures of both countries are ‘intricately linked.’ The pair breaks down business links across the border that account for both massive trade and some very dodgy wheeling and dealing, including involvement in some of the notorious scam centres. These links are historical and tied up in the military, making things difficult for the Thai civilian government. ‘One of the most difficult challenges facing Thailand’s Myanmar policy is that recent Thai military officers (and traditional politicians) have had affable relations with Myanmar state officials making it hard to deal with anti-state actors. The Thai army especially prefers to collaborate with the Myanmar army: senior officers from the two countries meet regularly in the promotion of defence diplomacy.’ This is, of course, long an issue in relations but given the shift in power and, crucially, the return of a meddling Thaksin Shinawatra, things are strained. ‘According to a source close to the Thai military, senior military officials were infuriated because the government had them out of the loop about Thaksin’s peace forays,’ Chambers and Chotisut write. It’s not just big-money collaboration. The Thai Ministry of Labour last week flagged the imminent closure of all centres issuing Certificates of Identification across the country. These certificates have allowed people from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos to move around legally and safely in Thailand after receiving a job offer. The ministry cited a request from Myanmar as behind the move, [Myanmar Now reports](https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/thailand-to-close-centres-issuing-id-certificates-to-myanmar-nationals/). Whether it’s a short-term move or a permanent shift in policy remains to be seen. Moe Kyaw, the associate secretary of the Thailand-based Yaung Chi Oo Workers Association, told Myanmar Now that if the ‘pink card’ job permit is reformed to allow workers to move more freely then it could be a good move, but we’ll see! ## 🇨🇳 A couple of visits to Beijing raise eyebrows, arms concerns Who needs Bangkok when you’ve got Beijing? [The Irrawaddy reports this week](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/myanmar-china-watch/china-filling-huge-arms-order-placed-by-myanmar-junta.html) that arms purchases are set to arrive in Myanmar from China within a month, citing sources in the capital and along the border. “The [regime’s] shopping list is long and huge arms caches are on the way to Myanmar,” the sources told the outlet. The report comes as the junta’s number two in command, Soe Win, visits China following a June trip by former president Thein Sein. [Leong Wai Kit at Channel News Asia](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/myanmar-china-junta-thein-sein-soe-win-cna-explains-4467241) has an intriguing explainer here that looks at the various rumours and which is most likely. There are a lot of interesting bits in here, but the line that a source said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi ‘had asked Thein Sein to persuade Min Aung Hlaing to hand over power and form an interim government to pave the way for elections’ sure got me. Similarly, curious to hear that Operation 1027 had derailed plans earlier in the year: “Beijing intended to engage deputy army chief Soe Win and would have invited him to China in the first quarter of the year. But back then, (military chief) Min Aung Hlaing had trust issues with Soe Win — that disrupted the engagement effort and China’s invitation. Meanwhile, via the diplomatic track (of) engagement, Thein Sein was able to make the trip to Beijing on Jun 28,” a source told CNA. The Irrawaddy’s position is that the visit for Soe Win is timed with a [resurgence in fighting in Shan State](https://thediplomat.com/2024/07/myanmar-juntas-no-2-visits-china-amid-intense-fighting/), which borders China, and is squarely about arms procurement. Sure, he’s ostensibly there for the Green Development Forum at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, but I did like Leong Wai Kit’s line about China’s use of multilaterals to engage the Myanmar junta without too much fuss. [Very intriguing report here from Nikkei Asia](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Crisis/Myanmar-regime-uses-Chinese-tech-to-surveil-internet-users-report-says) about a digital crackdown on dissent using Chinese tech. Research and digital rights group Justice For Myanmar alleged Chinese company Geedge Networks and state-owned China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation are behind the junta’s online surveillance operations. The group warns that the junta is building “a digital dictatorship” that monitors and censors widely in an effort to shut down dissent. VPNs have long been in the crosshairs of the regime and this piece follows an interesting thread on how vital the tools are for businesses still trying to operate in the country. Great read from Thompson Chau, as usual! ## 🇺🇸 A caucus and a potential pivot Washington DC isn’t one to be left out, it seems. [The Diplomat cites a source](https://thediplomat.com/2024/06/us-diplomat-reportedly-met-myanmar-naval-officer-in-vietnam/) with knowledge of the events who says Daniel Kritenbrink, the US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs (that’s a long business card), met with Myanmar Navy commander Kyaw Lin Zaw while in Hanoi on June 21 and 22. That visit was meant to be a post-Putin ‘hey, Vietnam, remember us’ but this does seem to be far juicier. The US State Department would not confirm or deny the visit but noted the US would continue “to deploy all diplomatic tools” to pressure the junta, [the Irrawaddy reports](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/myanmars-crisis-the-world/senior-us-diplomat-reportedly-met-myanmar-junta-navy-officer-in-hanoi.html). Meanwhile, Congress launched the Burma Caucus at the end of last month. The Caucus aims to “bolster congressional support for the Burmese people in their fight for democracy and human rights against the brutal military junta,” founders Betty McCollum and Bill Huizenga said in a statement. This is all a bit deep-DC for my tastes,[ but the Stimson Centre has a great overview](https://www.stimson.org/2024/the-promises-and-challenges-of-a-new-u-s-congressional-burma-caucus/) here. ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva traveled to Bolivia for the first time in his third administration to meet with his counterpart Luis Arce, reports MercoPress [ https://substack.com/redirect/1131f01b-7c2f-45ac-997b-f4a1d23cfe80?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. The two leaders discussed security issues including human trafficking and migration, as well as for shared healthcare access. President Lula also rejected allegations that the recent coup in Bolivia was staged by Arce himself in order to gain electoral support, says El País [ https://substack.com/redirect/913b9a7c-ce11-45f8-a642-22c0be24f81b?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. For the first time in 28 years, the joint declaration issued by Mercosur members did not mention Argentina’s sovereignty claim over the Malvinas Islands, in a notable rebuke against President Milei’s decision to not attend the bloc summit in Paraguay. (Buenos Aires Herald [ https://substack.com/redirect/327312e2-105f-4367-ae5c-91617a2cbd8e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) Latin American markets could be affected by a Donald Trump win in November, assesses Reuters [ https://substack.com/redirect/afc10ce4-082d-4191-8d1f-22b6bab286b6?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Mexico’s deep economic relationship with the U.S. and the issue of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela are both areas that could be impacted. Trump’s personal relationship with El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele and Argentina’s Javier Milei could also play a role in U.S. policy towards the region. In Americas Quarterly [ https://substack.com/redirect/92f31e57-512d-4110-bacb-851f41d081dc?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], Eduardo Levy Yeyati argues in favor of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in Latin America, believing it could “equalize wages downward while further reducing labor’s share of income.” However, he notes that the region is not currently prepared for widespread AI adoption, highlighting “rigid and outdated education systems, below-average math and reading scores, scarce and unequal digital connectivity, and limited vocational training and reskilling programs due to widespread precarity and informality.” Also in Americas Quarterly [ https://substack.com/redirect/2e0a2a1f-80d2-4dc2-b9d0-453bab265575?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], Lucia Dammert highlights the increasing entanglement between organized crime and politics in the region, noting that corruption, lack of transparency, and fragile institutions are key characteristics for criminal organizations to continue growing. Migration More than nine hundred thousand migrants, of the total ~2.5 million registered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in 2023, came from just six countries in Latin America. “Push factors—including organized crime-fueled violence and extortion and a lack of economic opportunities—combined with the pull of a strong U.S. labor market, make it unlikely migration flows will decrease substantially in the near future,” write Will Freeman, Steven Holmes, and Sabine Baumgartner for Council on Foreign Relations [ https://substack.com/redirect/7bd44003-5de7-4f37-a292-f0af77d1833b?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ].

Read more Far-right Patriots group springs to third force in European Parliament Viktor Orbán’s nationalist 'Patriots for Europe' group has been officially established in the European Parliament today, boasting 84 MEPs making it the third-largest group in the hemicycle. What does the French left-wing alliance’s shock election win mean for Europe? Experts say the anti-far-right bulwark has safeguarded the European bloc from a political shock.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://latinamericadailybriefing.substack.com/p/regions-conservatives-at-brazil-cpac The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Brazil this weekend showcased the relationship between past, present and potential far-right leaders in Latin America. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro — indicted just days ago in a case involving an attempt to embezzle jewelry gifted by Saudi Arabia — hosted rightwing luminaries, including Argentine President Javier Milei and Chilean politician José Antonio Kast. (Bloomberg [ https://substack.com/redirect/4b263023-59ad-40eb-b4f6-e5fbcc23556d?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]) El Salvador’s justice and security minister, Gustavo Villatoro, credited with the Bukele administration’s mano dura gang policy was also in attendance. Brazil’s far right is hoping to leverage municipal elections in October to wage a comeback after defeat in the 2022 presidential elections, reports El País [ https://substack.com/redirect/0e688b41-b73a-4fb6-a5f0-6546ff2a7706?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. Bolsonaro spoke on Saturday (before the French elections) and said the right was gaining ground internationally, in Italy and France, and said he hoped that former U.S. President Donald Trump will be returned to the White House this year, reports Reuters. Milei spoke to the conference on Sunday. It was his first visit to Brazil, Argentina’s most important trade partner, since taking office in December. He said criminal cases against Bolsonaro amount to political persecution, and warned of the evils of socialism. However, Milei avoided criticizing Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in his speech — amid media reports that Brazilian diplomats were considering pulling the country’s Buenos Aires ambassador if Milei repeated harsh insults against the leftist leader. Milei opted to skip today’s Mercosur meeting in Paraguay — a snub to the trade bloc, and to Lula, who has demanded an apology from Argentina’s leader.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://evanellis.substack.com/p/evan-ellis-paraguays-security-challenges Dear Colleague, I am proud to share with you my new work on the security challenges facing the government of Paraguay, and the working being done by the government of President Santiago Pena and his national security team to respond. The article is based on my April 2024 trip to the country, and meetings with senior government officials, security experts, academics, and others in the country. I argue that the success and security of Paraguay, which often receives little attention in Washington D.C., is far more strategically important than is recognized. The country is severely stressed by its location on one of South America’s key narcotrafficking routes, making it of particular interest to major transnational criminal organizations in neighboring Brazil, which often also source their arms through the country. Paraguay is further a source of much of the continent’s marijuana production, and Ciudad del Este, which borders neighboring Brazil and Argentina, serves as an important regional hub for the Islamic terrorist organization Hezbollah. The country is also beset by endemic corruption and a small if difficult to eliminate homegrown terrorist organization. Despite its challenges, however, the Pena government, in coordination with the U.S., Brazil, Taiwan, and Paraguay’s other international partners, has made important and credible strides to address the nation’s challenges.

      "Text: Hello friends! I promised a Myanmar update on Friday but I accidentally lied. I forgot it was my birthday and instead spent the day collecting orders from the Asia Bookroom and eating potato scallops with my granddad. A day off ahead of a very busy week may have been a wise move. I’m nervous about the South China Sea, where a meeting between diplomats from Beijing and Manila may not hold for long at all. I’m also very curious about what’s happening between the Myanmar junta and China. In Indonesia, new tariffs may well cause a headache for the government and I never know what’s going on in Malaysia but I try my hardest. Thank you to all premium subscribers who help support this free weekly update. If you’d like to join that list, please do so here: Upgrade to premium Dari Mulut ke Mulut (https://darimulut.beehiiv.com/upgrade) See you then, Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— # What I’m watching this week View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9bca8489-23c0-45c7-81bf-ff9211870bb7/laura-adai-4waCIctXbcU-unsplash.jpg?t=1720344200) Caption: #### 🇵🇭 Another week on choppy waters It was a busy weekend for the Philippine Coast Guard after it revealed an enormous 165-metre vessel from the Chinese Coast Guard was spotted encroaching on the Philippines EEZ on July 2, Reuters reports. “It's an intimidation on the part of the China Coast Guard. We're not going to pull out and we're not going to be intimidated,” PGC spokesperson Jay Tarriela told reporters on Saturday. The Inquirer later reported that similar vessels were seen intercepting two PGC vessels on Sunday near the Second Thomas Shoal. “Philippines Coast Guard BRP Cabra and BRP Cape Engano now passing, 14 nautical miles (nm) east of Second Thomas Shoal. They have been intercepted by China Coast Guard 5203 and at least six China maritime militia vessels, now closely shadowing,” Ray Powell posted, [as reported by the Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.net/408261/ccg-militia-vessels-intercept-2-pcg-boats-near-ayungin-west-ph-sea-monitor/?utm_medium=gallery&utm_source=(direct)). PGC has not confirmed the report. The timing here is intriguing. Assuming eventual confirmation of Sunday’s breaking news, these two incidents sandwich an enormous meeting last week between China and the Philippines in Manila. That meeting came in the shadow of the mid-June clash in which one Filipino lost a finger and sparked a flurry of headlines about the US defence treaty. Both sides “affirmed their commitment to de-escalate tensions without prejudice to their respective positions. There was substantial progress on developing measures to manage the situation at sea, but significant differences remain,” the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said in a statement, [as per the AP](https://apnews.com/article/south-china-sea-philippines-disputes-487b5a066b624f3505df4758f97edd01). Now what? #### 🇲🇲 Second junta boss heads to China Vice-Senior General Soe Win, the second-in-command in Myanmar’s military junta, touched down in Shandong province, China, over the weekend, [AFP reports here](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/top-myanmar-general-in-china-for-official-visit). He’s attending the Green Development Forum hosted by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, as per junta media. It’s interesting timing. Soe Win’s boss, Min Aung Hlaing, hasn’t popped over since seizing control of the country and it comes right as the China-brokered peace deal in northern Shan state collapsed. China-Myanmar junta relations are a tricky, tricky business so I’ll be watching enthusiastically for analysis in the coming days. #### 🇹🇭 Red light for cannabis in Thailand As long threatened by the Srettha Thaivisin government, cannabis is back on the naughty list. Cannabis and hemp will both be reclassified as narcotics from Jan. 1 following a committee meeting led by Dr Surachoke Tangwiwat, deputy permanent secretary at the Ministry of Public Health, [Bangkok Post reports](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2823881/cannabis-set-to-return-to-illegal-drugs-list-after-vote). Not unexpected by any means but certainly very puzzling on how this will work in practice. Cannabis has already become a major industry in Thailand and those stakeholders won’t be going down easily. Demonstrations planned for this week will see pro-cannabis advocates make their case for keeping the drug accessible. Former health minister Anutin Charnvirakul, whose CV includes changing the laws that allowed cannabis to prosper like this, [wants answers](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2824301/pro-cannabis-groups-to-rally-at-government-house). He says the same committee that wants recriminalisation voted to decriminalise it during his era, so what gives? “We've relaxed the regulations to allow people to make use of cannabis. What will happen to people who grow cannabis? Will they face legal action? What about some 8,000 cannabis-related offenders who were freed in June 2022?” #### 🇮🇩 Business bites back in Indonesia Massive new tariffs flagged by Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan last week are not the answer says Arsjad Rasjid, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, [told Nikkei Asia](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Indonesia-business-lobby-says-tariffs-not-solution-for-industry). The Ministry is eyeing up to 200% tariffs on ‘imported footwear, clothing, textiles, cosmetics and ceramics,’ Nikkei notes, in an effort to safeguard local industries from cheap imports manufactured elsewhere in Asia. “The [minister's] spirit is good for the industry, ... but [it is] not the solution,” Arsjad said. “The key is governance … so that there is a fair competition.” Business might not be happy, but the Ministry is tossing up extending the tariff program further. Electronics are on the agenda, [Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-05/indonesia-says-tariff-review-could-cover-more-goods-countries?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google), adding that the Minister flagged introducing the tariff on products from the European Union and Australia also. “We are not targeting a certain country,” Zulkifli said on Friday after days of headlines pointing to Chinese imports. #### 🇲🇾 The Najib spectre haunts, but not from home Najib Razak is not going anywhere, the Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled last Wednesday. His legal team argued the former prime minister should serve his monumental corruption sentences at home but the court found that a no-go and declined a full hearing, [Al Jazeera reports](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/3/malaysias-najib-loses-bid-to-serve-corruption-sentence-in-house-arrest). Najib will appeal. “The court said there is no legal duty but in terms of ethics, the government should have answered,” his lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told media. With poor showings for Najib’s UMNO in recent by-elections, the ruling appears to have hit the party hard, [as Malaysiakini reports here](https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/711134). UMNO supreme council member Puad Zarkashi vented over the weekend that until Najib is freed, the party will leak Malay support: “For UMNO members and Najib's sympathisers, as long as he is denied his rights and fair trial, they will hesitate. Malay support will not recover.” I love an introspective time for UMNO, so I’m looking forward to see what this train of thought produces. #### 🇲🇾 The Tun inches on a ton It would be remiss of me not to note another big birthday this July. Former prime minister and the eldest of regional elder statesmen Mahathir Mohamad will turn 99 on Wednesday. [He sat down with Sinar Daily](https://www.sinardaily.my/article/219145/videos/fireside-chat/politics-corruption-and-possible-revenge-fireside-chat-with-tun-dr-mahathir-mohamad) at the end of June to chat all things politics, raising his concerns about the current leadership and the economic stresses of everyday Malaysians. American readers may want to skip that one, he’s in very lucid form. ## Interesting reads [Indonesian band takes stand for Taiwan’s migrant workers](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/7/1/indonesian-band-takes-stand-for-taiwans-migrant-workers) (Al Jazeera) _Originally from the town of Indramayu in West Java, Rudi struggled to find work in his home country. “It’s hard to find a job in Indonesia, almost impossible,” he told Al Jazeera. “I didn’t have any permanent job. I did everything I could.”_ _Rudi moved to Taiwan in 2015 to operate heavy machinery in a factory. Like many of the island’s 768,000-odd migrant workers, he was looking for employment and the chance to build a better life._ _But the reality is often more complicated. While migrant workers earn more in Taiwan, many find themselves exploited, trapped in debt or facing physical and sexual abuse. In the face of this, many are pushing back, forming labour unions and NGOs, and engaging in protests varying from flash mob dances to musical performances._ [Southeast Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiyah to be disbanded, say its senior leaders](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/southeast-asian-militant-group-jemaah-islamiyah-be-disbanded-say-its-senior-2024-07-04/) (Reuters) _In the statement, captured on video and shared online, the leaders confirmed their commitment to the Indonesian state and law, and said all material taught in JI-affiliated boarding schools would be in line with orthodox Islam._ _\"It is too early to say what the consequences are, but the men who signed the statement have enough respect and credibility within the organisation to ensure widespread acceptance,\" said Sidney Jones, who authored IPAC's preliminary analysis._ [The ‘fearless young activists’ thrown in jail for climate campaigns in Cambodia](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/06/asia/mother-nature-cambodia-climate-youth-activists-intl-hnk/index.html) (CNN) _But it’s on TikTok that their videos really make an impression on young Cambodian users like Run Bunry, a high-school student from the capital Phnom Penh and his friends. “They are positive and lighthearted and also teach us a lot about the environment,” he said._ _One video, highlighting an investigation into the alleged illegal export of rare silica sand, showed three members buried up to their heads in sand and was shared more than 1,000 times. Another viral video taken along a beach in the coastal city Sihanoukville showed the extent of alleged illegal construction by hotels and casinos on the shore._ ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

      "Text: View this post on the web at https://www.piratewireservices.com/p/petros-war-of-words-with-press-freedom Colombian President Gustavo Petro has spent weeks embroiled in a public fight with the country’s main advocacy group for journalists, the Foundation of the Liberty and Independence of the Press (FLIP). It isn’t the first time Petro has gone on the offensive against journalists [ https://substack.com/redirect/0bce076a-cf49-40e1-b1aa-250f85992d43?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] or the FLIP. But the catalyst for this most recent fight between the most powerful man in Colombia and one of the few organizations that protect journalists in a country that ranks in the bottom third of press freedoms worldwide [ https://substack.com/redirect/887bd061-972f-4007-aaae-d3c5ff94fd80?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] was a series of articles about the alleged corruption of ex-cabinet members in his administration. On Twitter, Gustavo Petro called the articles \"Mossad journalism\", suggesting that the journalist who wrote them, María Jimena Duzán, was involved in a coordinated disinformation campaign to damage his government. He also called on the FLIP to persecute journalists who publish what he has often called “fake news”— a term popularized by former U.S. president Donald Trump. On June 26, FLIP issued a statement [ https://substack.com/redirect/11a7061b-79ad-42c9-b902-dcd8fdae9685?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] in which it expressed its concern about the accusations that Petro had issued against media and journalists who investigate alleged acts of corruption by people close to his government team. \"We reiterate our concern for the strategy maintained by President Gustavo Petro to discredit and stigmatize the work of journalists and media outlets that oversee the management of his government, thus ignoring his obligation as president to promote an optimal climate for the exercise of journalistic work,\" said the Foundation. “Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are fundamental rights that must be guaranteed by the State and exercised with responsibility,” continued the FLIP in their statement Being a local beat journo in Colombia is deadly work Colombia is among the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, especially local journalists who investigate the nexus between criminal groups and politicians in areas plagued by conflict. Five such journalists have been murdered in Colombia in the last 19 months over their anti-corruption work. Two other journalists' murders are also under investigation for less clear circumstances. But instead of retreating from his comments after the statement by the FLIP, Petro instead doubled down with new public attacks. From there, thousands of messages containing disinformation or stigmatizing the FLIP were sent by the president’s followers, digital influencers with wide resonance, members of Congress of his party (Historical Pact), and appointed government officials— some of which Petro amplified on his Twitter account [ https://substack.com/redirect/3e069acb-3636-43dd-9433-27798dff28c9?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. The false claims included accusations that the FLIP protects only wealthy right-wing journalists (they don’t), that they didn’t defend journalists who exposed corruption or malfeasance in previous right-wing administrations (they did) and that they don’t offer services or amplify independent or local journalists, especially in conflict areas (that is, in fact, their principal activity). In the following days, he suggested [ https://substack.com/redirect/d55c282a-24d6-4f27-852c-d383224e6633?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] that because one of the founders of the FLIP, who has not formed part of the organization for more than 20 years, has been accused of ties to paramilitary organizations, the FLIP must be inherently corrupt. He also repeatedly referred to journalists pushing back against the false accusations as “neo-nazis”. He also, falsely, claimed that the organization had never released a statement condemning the deaths of 158 journalists in Gaza. They have [ https://substack.com/redirect/bbf038a6-15b4-44a0-8371-6e61d24c4283?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]. As journalists across the political spectrum began to unify around the FLIP [ https://substack.com/redirect/eb558374-6e24-4802-af83-a8438f99fb74?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], he doubled down on attacks rather than backtracking. During a 5-day tweetstorm on the subject, he publicly attacked a freelance journalist [ https://substack.com/redirect/5016f093-62ab-4426-aa93-d9172bfd55d8?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] who writes for center-left newspaper El Espectador who was trying to clear up the confusion, and calling the false accusations dangerous. The accusations led to some of the president's millions of followers harassing, and at times even threatening, journalists who have spoken out about press freedoms in the country. The fight goes international “I think this popular outrage comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about what the FLIP does,” said Adriaan Alsema, editor and founder of Colombia Reports [ https://substack.com/redirect/8450e2fc-6a04-4836-93af-f3b0e4cb66b1?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], the oldest English-language online news website in the country. “Every day the organization is helping journalists in conflict areas apply for protection from the state, issuing flak jackets and helmets to those covering riots and civil disturbances, providing legal resources to journalists being accused of libel by corrupt politicians” and other actions that aid journalists facing physical or legal threats, including money for hotels and travel when local journalists face immediate threat are forced to flee as a result of their work, he told PWS. As the public battle escalated, institutions both within and outside of the country issued statements expressing concern over Petro’s actions. The Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation (PARES), a Colombian NGO that advocates for peace implementation in Colombia released a communique [ https://substack.com/redirect/cbb2876d-48e6-4a34-9f8b-4846e29636e1?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] reminding the president that “the FLIP has a long history of protecting journalists no matter who the president may be”. Reporters Without Borders, (RSF by their French acronym), an international NGO that tracks press freedom worldwide, said [ https://substack.com/redirect/bb0cc870-ceb3-448d-9f6c-e2217f904eca?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ]the organization “categorically rejects” statements by Petro, and “any harassment” towards those journalists who exercise that right. The Committee to Protect Journalists, (CPJ), also issued a statement [ https://substack.com/redirect/35e06d9f-a7b0-426b-8fe7-0ddc6886b6b8?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] expressing concern that “Petro’s stigmatizing discourse against the press and journalists encourages other authorities and his supporters to do the same, putting investigations on issues of public interest at risk.” Petro did not immediately respond to the statements.

Press Freedom in Colombia Colombia has long struggled with press freedom, not just due to physical threats from criminal groups, but also due to institutional oppression by the Colombian state. According to RSF, the country ranks 119th of 180 countries in the world.

Some of that media landscape, particularly columnists for large right-wing propaganda outlets [ https://substack.com/redirect/a578ed41-fbee-41de-a674-9ddb2c5a7aa3?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ], have released thinly sourced opinion pieces making wild accusations against the Petro administration. “There is good journalism and bad journalism, as in all professions, said Ana Cristina Restrepo, president of the board at the FLIP. “But freedom of the press is a mark of democracy.” Laura Bonilla, deputy director of PARES said that the mission of FLIP \"is not to control the press, nor its quality, but to defend freedom of the press\". \"It is true that Colombia has had a media that has been very complacent with power, but at the same time brave, honest and ethical journalists\", have risked their lives to expose wrongdoings by the state. Press freedom under Petro has improved in comparison to the previous administration of Iván Duque, who was criticized for widespread police repression of journalists during a national strike in 2021 (a phenomenon well documented by the FLIP [ https://substack.com/redirect/b7feda79-9d54-4037-80b5-bfcac33ba2ce?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ] at the time) as well as spying on journalists critical of his administration. When Duque left office, the country was ranked 134th in the world, a position that Petro has improved, in contrast with previous governments in Colombia, simply by not physically attacking journalists. But the risk is that stigmatization and demonization of the entire journalistic profession by the National Government sends a signal of impunity for actions against journalists as individuals, and reverses those gains. Petro promised in the campaign to end such practices. He currently faces an opportunity to do so. Or he could adopt the strategy of strongmen in Latin America like Bukele and Ortega, who intimidate critical voices and, at times into exile.

The Big Headlines in LATAM Panama announced the closure of three of the main encampments that receive and provide humanitarian assistance to migrants who have entered the country via the Darien Gap. The decision will endanger the lives of migrants in what is already the most dangerous land corridor for migration in the world. The move also occurs amidst U.S. pressure to cut down on migration throughout the Americas, and a new joint anti-migrant operation between U.S. and Panamanian officials. We covered this dynamic in depth for paid subscribers in this week’s “Ship’s Log”. Ship’s Log Last week we experienced a formatting error when we published our weekly newsletter. When the story was transferred from google docs to the website, the same paragraph duplicated itself three times in the body of the article. The error was quickly corrected on the website, but unfortunately, the email had already been sent to 2,000 subscribers. We apologize for the error. If you didn’t catch the piece, which was on migrants being lost in the Darien Gap, we urge you to give the updated version another glance. Thank you again and we regret the error. Spanish Word of the Week periodismo amarillista - Yellow journalism “Yellow journalism”, in English sounds a bit antiquated. It came originally from the U.K. to refer to newspapers that relied on gross exaggerations, insinuation or outright propaganda to drive newspaper sales. It refers, in short, to all the worst ethical presses of a free press. But the term is still very much alive in common usage among Spanish speakers. And the phenomenon of yellow journalism is alive and well all over the world. Unfortunately, some journalists are more interested in driving a pre-conceived narrative than uncovering the truth. And even more sadly, some aren’t above outright lying. But despite the bad actors, no matter where you go, journalism (and the right to criticize power) remain fundamental for a free society. And a lot of journalists all over the world risk their lives every day to do exactly that. Please support them if you can! They deserve it.

      "[{'text': 'View this post on the web at  Spontaneous protests started in diverse locations around Venezuela yesterday, after electoral authorities said Nicolás Maduro won reelection in Sunday’s presidential vote, without releasing tallies proving the results. Laboratorio de Paz [  ] verified 210 protests — notably in working class neighborhoods that have traditionally been chavista strongholds [  ] — throughout the day, and at least seven statues of Hugo Chávez were torn down. (Runrun.es [  ]) “Protesters decapitated one of the statues and dragged the bronze head through the streets on a chain tied to a motorcycle,” reports El País [  ]. At least four people were killed and dozens injured as security forces responded to protests with tear gas and rubber bullets, reports AFP [  ]. 46 were detained, according to Foro Penal. Voluntad Popular, an opposition party, said one of its leaders, Freddy Superlano was kidnapped and shared a video showing a man being pulled out of an SUV by armed and hooded people dressed in black. (Efecto Cocuyo [  ], Runrun.es [  ], Infobae [  ]) Throughout yesterday, “social media filled with reports of opposition marches originating in poor communities across town and clashes with security forces and pro-Maduro motorbike gangs known as colectivos who were filmed shooting into the air,” reports the Guardian [  ]. Protesters in Cumaná, 250 miles east of the capital, tried to reach the country’s election headquarters, but they were pushed back by the National Guard, reports the New York Times [  ]. Stores in Caracas are largely shuttered today, and there are long lines of people stocking up at places that are open, reports El País [  ]. The government has portrayed the protests as criminal gatherings aimed at a coup d’etat, and called for rallies in support of Maduro later today. Today Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino [  ] said “we are in the presence of a coup d’etat carried out by fascist groups supported by North American imperialists and their allies.” He said the armed forces would not allow a coup. (Efecto Cocuyo [  ]) Opposition leaders called for peaceful assemblies today. Opposition presidential candidate Edmundo González called on security forces not to repress protesters. (Efecto Cocuyo [  ]) The tallies Opposition leaders said they have obtained tallies from more than 70 percent of the country’s polling stations, and that the results they document make Maduro’s reelection mathematically impossible. In a speech yesterday, María Corina Machado said the tallies obtained by the opposition show Maduro obtained only 2.76 million votes, while González obtained 6.27 million. (Efecto Cocuyo [  ], Miami Herald [  ]) While Maduro has been accused of electoral fraud in the past, the difference between the electoral authority’s claim and the oppositions’ is of a far more significant magnitude this time. Earlier today an Organization of American States report said there was \"exceptional manipulation\" of the election results that handed Maduro his win. Steve Levitsky, an expert on democracy at Harvard University, called Sunday’s vote “one of the most egregious electoral frauds in modern Latin American history.” (New York Times [  ]) “Maduro made a grave mistake by allowing the fraud. Not only has he isolated himself again in the cell of illegitimacy from which he tried so hard to escape. In one leap he turned his government into a tyranny and Chavismo into totalitarianism,” writes Boris Muñoz in El País [  ]. The OAS called for an urgent meeting of its members to discuss the election, and suggested that a new vote should take place to resolve the discrepancies in results. (Associated Press [  ]) A growing chorus of international actors are demanding Venezuela release the evidence backing its electoral results. Maduro has said the data remains unpublished do to a hacker attack. (Folha de S. Paulo [  ]) The Carter Center [  ], which sent a team of electoral observers for the vote, called on the electoral authority to immediately publish the complete results by polling station, yesterday. Today the Carter Center said it was cancelling a report planned for this morning and will be pulling its team out of Venezuela. (CNN [  ]) Both Brazil, Colombia and Mexico whose governments have previously sought dialogue with Maduro, have called for more detailed electoral information to be released. A blatantly stolen election will further isolate Venezuela’s government. (Efecto Cocuyo [  ]) Brazilian diplomat Celso Amorim, who was in Caracas for the election, expressed caution yesterday, saying he could not make judgement on the process without the full results, and called on authorities to release the data for each ballot box. (O Globo [  ]) Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is scheduled to speak with U.S. President Joe Biden on the issue later today, reports El País [  ]. Nine Latin American countries called in a joint statement for a \"complete review of the results with the presence of independent electoral observers.\" “But the diplomatic capacity to influence the Chavista government has always been limited,” writes Boris Muñoz in El País [  ]. “Never before has this been so clear. Following the announcement of the election results, various democracies have expressed their concern. Maduro has responded in the crudest way: expelling the ambassadors of several countries in the region.” Maduro’s government has lashed out a critics, and announced yesterday it was withdrawing all of Venezuela’s diplomats from seven Latin American countries, including Argentina, Chile and Peru, and demanding those countries’ governments respond in kind. (Washington Post [  ]) Predictions While the protests are a sign of popular anger, which also pushed a strong voter participation rate on Sunday, despite obstacles, “Maduro appears to have the support of the top civilian and military leadership,” notes James Bosworth at Latin America Risk Report [  ]. The Venezuelan government’s ability to repress protesters is not concentrated in the armed forces, rather it is spread out over five units of official security organizations, and unofficial forces that include paramilitaries and criminal groups, writes Javier Corrales on Twitter [  ]. “Vzla has one of the most repressive apparatuses imaginable.” “Historically, the Maduro regime has not given concessions voluntarily, and it will not do so now. The key question moving forward is how to provide incentives, within the boundaries of the rule of law, to individuals who can help the country move away from the current repressive apparatus toward the complicated path to democracy,” writes Tamara Taraciuk Broner in Americas Quarterly [  ]. As protests and repression mounted yesterday, “it became clear that Maduro was willing to take the next step—and become a fully rogue, isolated, Nicaragua-style regime if necessary to retain power,” writes Brian Winter in Americas Quarterly [  ]. “In the aftermath of these elections, assuming the security apparatus remains loyal to Maduro and is able to squash any civil resistance, Venezuela’s international isolation will worsen, with more sanctions expected,” writes Jeremy McDermott in InSight Crime [  ]. “This isolation is going to deepen Venezuela’s financial crisis and Maduro’s reliance on criminal networks and illegal rents to keep his cash-starved regime afloat.” Final note “Pause to appreciate the irony that the electoral system put in place by Hugo Chavez included a verification mechanism to prevent stolen elections and that verification mechanism (the printed actas at each voting site) is now functioning to prove that Chavez\\'s successor stole an election,” notes James Bosworth at the Latin America Risk Report [  ]. Regional Civilian control has been key in limiting military coups in Latin America in recent decades, write Shannon O’Neil and Will Freeman for the Council on Foreign Relations [  ]. Migration More than 55,000 Chinese migrants have illegally entered the U.S. through Mexico over the past year and a half, “the largest wave of illegal border crossings by Chinese immigrants in history — part of a wider influx that is also bringing record numbers of migrants from South America, India, Turkey and an array of African nations,” reports the Washington Post [  ]. A mass exodus from Chiapas to Guatemala last week — more than 500 Mexicans fled their homes, emptying entire communities — is a response to violence linked to territorial conflict between drug cartels. “But the conflict between these groups has also taken in and inflamed existing tensions in a region with a history of violence over access to land,” reports the Guardian [  ]. (See last Friday’s briefs [  ].) Mexico Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García was not tricked into traveling to Texas, last week, rather he was abducted by Joaquín Guzmán López, a younger Sinaloa Cartel leader, who “with a group of henchmen who handcuffed him, stuck a bag over his head and muscled him into a car and then on to the plane, where he remained bound throughout the flight,” reports the New York Times [  ]. (See yesterday’s briefs [  ].) Ioan Grillo at Crashout [  ] has more details from a member of El Mayo’s security team: “he claimed that U.S. agents were at the house in Culiacán when Mayo was kidnapped.” “Cartel operatives across northwest Mexico are bracing for a potential explosion of violence following the arrest,” according to Crashout. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called on to drug cartels not to fight each other following last week’s detention of top Sinaloa Cartel leaders in the U.S., an unusual public appeal, reports the Associated Press [  ]. Colombia “Violence against LGBTQ+ individuals has been on the rise in Colombia: eight trans women were killed between February and April this year, while 41 were killed in 2023,” reports the Guardian [  ]. “Activists say armed groups are seeking to create a parallel state where those who are seen as damaging society – which for them includes trans women – are punished or killed.” El Salvador Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s promises for a futuristic “Bitcoin City” have yet to materialize, but the real-life residents of Conchagua have already been forced to sell their land to make room for it. Those who dare to oppose have faced arrest and harassment under the ongoing state of exception, reports El Faro English [  ]. Cuba Almost 90 percent of Cubans will live in conditions of “extreme poverty” this year, according to a new study by Cuban Observatory of Human Rights. The study also revealed that 86% of Cuban households exist “on the margins of survival” and that, of these, 61% do not even have enough “to buy the essentials to survive.” (El País [  ]) Argentina Argentine President Javier Milei announced the creation of Unit of Artificial Intelligence Applied to Security, a special unit that will deal with cyberpatrolling on social media and the internet, the analysis of security cameras in real time and aerial surveillance using drones, among other things, reports El País [  ]. Olympics Brazilian gymnast Rebeca Andrade is the strongest challenger to U.S. Olympian Simone Biles’ dominance in the field, but “the relationship between the pair, who are of similar ages and backgrounds, bears little of the animus that often characterizes rivalries among elite performers,” reports the Washington Post [  ]. “At competitions, they cheer each other on. And at crucial junctures in Andrade’s career, moments when she questioned whether she’d ever realize her potential, Biles has gone further, encouraging the athlete fated to be her top competitor.”

The totals (rounded) are 6.3 million votes for Edmundo Gonzalez and 2.8 million for Nicolas Maduro. The opposition won in every state. They won in precincts that previously voted heavily in favor of the Chavistas. It is a mathematical impossibility for Maduro to have won the election given that data. The opposition will post all its evidence online to be reviewed by international observers, who should be able to confirm that Gonzalez won. The CNE is obligated to post the same data for 100% of the voting precincts, but they haven\\'t done so because they are complicit in covering up Maduro\\'s loss. The CNE announced Maduro is the winner of the election by a completely made up 51-44 number. Maduro appears to have the support of the top civilian and military leadership. There are still layers of repressive forces around him. The main questions I\\'ve received in the past 24 hours are \"does Maduro leave?\" and \"how does Maduro leave?\" Similar to my pre-election scenarios (I posted a summary here [  ]; some clients have a longer memo), you can divide the potential scenarios into three buckets that aren\\'t completely mutually exclusive, but close enough for this exercise. There are plenty of sub-scenarios underneath each bucket, some better than others. Status quo: Maduro holds on to power Change: Someone else takes over the presidency Chaos: Control is contested for months to come 0. Status quo remains a likely outcome. Maduro has the tools of repression. He has survived previous waves of protests, controversial elections, and attempts to oust his government. From a prediction model standpoint, call it the tyranny of base rates of tyranny. Consolidated dictatorships survive everything until they reach a peak moment of crisis or a very specific set of circumstances (usually involving security forces suddenly turning against them). So prediction models rarely tip to >50% likely to fall in the next 12 months because the past precedent is that they survive more often than they crash. Usually, there are only a few days or weeks of warning before the transition comes. But dictatorships do crash sometimes, even when the odds are against that happening. And some indicators are flashing red in Venezuela including the mass protests that hit the streets yesterday. Part of the reason I\\'m writing this memo today is that I\\'m working through the question whether Maduro will stay or go. Scenarios for change So let\\'s talk about the scenarios everyone wants to hear about in which change comes to the country. How does change come to Venezuela? What indicators would show that change is more likely? There are five basic scenarios in which Maduro loses power in the next six months, in order of most to least likely: 1. Maduro accepts defeat in the election. If change does surprisingly come in Venezuela in the coming months, it\\'s most likely from this scenario. The immediate criticism of this scenario is \"But he already claimed victory!?!?!\" Yes, but he can change his mind. Pressure from protests and the international community can force Maduro to admit that the CNE recount shows he actually lost the election. At that point, a negotiation takes place that likely grants him amnesty, gives the military some promises of stability, and gives the Chavistas some sort of power-sharing arrangement. Maduro goes for an extended beach vacation in Cuba. The reason this is the most likely change scenario is that it is a semi-dignified exit that protects the interests of those in power and those in the region. This scenario is almost exactly the same as the unlikely but possible scenarios discussed before the election in which Maduro accepts the loss (the same way authoritarians lost elections in Nicaragua, Chile, and Honduras), just a week or two later than scheduled. It\\'s the change scenario that Venezuela\\'s neighbors would like to see, vs the other four scenarios below are the ones they want to avoid. One thing standing in this scenario\\'s way is that the Chavistas have lost some leverage with the mass vote against them and the protests. They would have been better off negotiating three months ago, but hubris led them to a massive election defeat and then an attempt to hold on while tens of thousands took the streets. They won\\'t get as much in a transition negotiation now as they would have gotten before. To be clear: This is the scenario we should all want to happen! This is the scenario I want to happen. Everyone in the international community right now should be pushing for Maduro to change his mind and accept electoral defeat and a transition. That would be the most stable outcome for Venezuela and the one that leads to improving the country in the coming years. The pressure should be on the Chavista civilian and military leadership around Maduro to convince them that this is the correct next step. As ugly as it is and even if he doesn\\'t deserve it, the international community and Maduro\\'s domestic opponents should be willing to offer lots of incentives for him to leave. 2. Military coup. Security force defection is the top way dictators leave power globally. There are two ways this military coup happens. First, Vladimir Padrino Lopez says, \"time is up\" and leads a unified group of military commanders to toss out Maduro. At that point, Padrino begins talking with other actors to figure out who the next civilian president is and that person gets to be civilian president as long as they promise to not turn on the military commanders who committed the coup. This seems unlikely at the moment as Venezuela\\'s minister of defense has said he respects Maduro\\'s electoral victory, but like Maduro, he can change his mind. Second, if the top generals refuse to flip, several units led by a lower ranking officer make the attempt. The DGCIM (Cuba-backed military counter-intelligence) exists to prevent this second coup scenario. They make it very hard for lower level units to coordinate a rebellion and shut down whispers of coups very early. But if enough units defected at the same time, the coordination could come about organically. One warning: military coups usually don\\'t lead to democratic governments. They usually lead to more military coups and dictatorships. The theory that the military steps in, forces Maduro out, then hands the leadership to Edmundo Gonzalez and steps back from politics as a democratic transition consolidates is an idealized world that rarely occurs. That\\'s why a coup is less ideal than Maduro accepting defeat. It spills over into the chaos scenarios. 3. Protests plus security force indifference. Whether coordinated from the top or not, if the security forces stop repressing protesters, the protesters can take over government installations and toss out Maduro and his allies. There are layers of repression managed by multiple institutions (as Javier Corrales explained on Twitter yesterday [  ]). In yesterday\\'s protests, colectivos and plain-clothed police officers were the ones firing bullets into the crowds of protesters, giving them some level of impunity from prosecution. Similar to the lower level military coup scenario, the DGCIM and other institutions prevent security forces from coordinating their actions, making it very dangerous for any single unit to refuse to repress protesters. The military isn’t the main actor in this effort and cannot control the repression from the top down. Globally, protests against dictatorships used to work but haven\\'t succeeded after Arab Spring. Dictatorships have gotten their repressive mechanisms in order. Nicaragua, where Ortega and his security forces killed protesters until they were forced to give up, is a brutal case in point for the region. It would be great for Venezuela to be a rare counter-example of protests succeeding at tossing out a dictator, but not something I would bet on. 4. Assassination or Accident. While a systemic military coup is the bigger threat, Maduro needs to be concerned about rogue officers or even civilians who can get close to him. Once again, there are plenty of security forces in place to attempt to prevent this scenario. While I\\'m sure some people would cheer, it\\'s a bad scenario for any transition as it leaves a power vacuum and potentially encourages retaliatory violence down the line. 5. International intervention. Nobody is advocating for this at the moment. The only two ways this occurs are 1) Maduro crosses an international border and tries to invade a neighboring country (I wrote about why that is unlikely [  ] late last year) or 2) Maduro commits an abuse so horrific that the international community is forced to step in under a responsibility to protect framework. Neither of these scenarios seems possible at the moment and I think Maduro understands the red lines he needs to respect to avoid this scenario. What about the chaos scenarios? I’m not dealing with this category today other than to say many of the change scenarios I outlined above would have fallen into my pre-election memo\\'s chaos scenarios. I\\'ve moved the bar on these definitions post-election. There remain some concerning scenarios involving long term civil conflict, but I\\'m more focused today on the immediate question of whether the Maduro regime stays or goes. What should happen in the coming days? At the top of this newsletter, I noted that the opposition has the evidence to prove they won the election. This is where the international community\\'s focus should be for the next few days. Demand the CNE release the vote totals. But as the CNE refuses to do so, count the vote receipts the opposition is holding as evidence. The receipts demonstrating with mathematical certainty that Maduro lost the election are a big hit to his legitimacy, well beyond the more complicated (but accurate!) claims of past stolen elections. Pause to appreciate the irony that the electoral system put in place by Hugo Chavez included a verification mechanism to prevent stolen elections and that verification mechanism (the printed actas at each voting site) is now functioning to prove that Chavez\\'s successor stole an election. There are going to be protests and those protests will face violent repression. On top of demanding election results, the international community must inform Maduro that it is watching the repression and send messages that they are monitoring specific actors. Perpetrators and authors of violence will be held responsible. Convincing any sector of the security forces to stop repression or to reconsider their loyalty can help Maduro realize that his best exit is one he negotiates rather than one that is forced upon him at gunpoint. So what’s the prediction? I don’t have a new specific public prediction right this moment. I made my public prediction pre-election [  ] with the information I had at that moment and I think it was a good one and not yet resolved. The situation is fluid enough right now that any updated prediction I write in the newsletter might be out of date by the end of the day. Even if the prediction models say Maduro is favored to hold on, oppositions win by fighting against the odds. Their bravery is humbling and their execution of a strategy to get this far has been impressive. To the extent I can advocate for change, I will. I’m not an unbiased analyst. I’m happy to say I’m biased on the issue of hoping for and working towards a democratic Venezuela. For those in Venezuela who have helped inform my knowledge of events in recent days and my analysis of these scenarios, stay safe.

Despite widespread fear —and sometimes fatalistic certainty— that Maduro would not respect the results of a referendum on his decade-long rule, many both within the country and without, reveled over the strongest challenge to Maduro since he assumed the presidency [  ]. From Caracas to Madrid, to Bogotá, even in Canada and Australia, the 8-million-strong Venezuela diaspora celebrated elections in the streets in dozens of world capitals— despite the fact that the vast majority of them had been disenfranchised from the voting process by their birth country. But as the day progressed, festivity transformed into tension as irregularities plagued election processes. Long lines, especially in areas where the opposition tends to do well, forced some voters to wait 4 to 5 hours to cast their votes. Some voting centers never opened at all. By the afternoon, some lost their patience, quarreling with election officials and security forces alike over suspicions that the delays were intentional. When polls closed at 6 p.m., many Venezuelans were still waiting to vote. Turnout, according to opposition election observers, was the highest it has been in years. Meanwhile, the country’s election body, the National Election Council, (CNE), controlled by Maduro’s party, and which usually provides updates on voter-turnout and begins releasing counts, suddenly went silent. That silence continued for 4 hours. Anchors at state media companies filled the information with meaningless banter, and at least one station simply gave up and switched over to showing a movie from the United States instead. Just after 10 p.m., Maduro appeared on national T.V. “The results of the election are irreversible,” he said, and promptly declared victory with 51% of the vote, although CNE had still not released any voting data. He blamed the delay on a \"terrorist attack\" on Venezuelan election systems from abroad, called on the people to \"respect the results of the election\", and \"celebrate this triumph of the Bolivarian revolution. He offered no details or proof about the alleged terrorist attack. Opposition supporters immediately accused the government of fraud and demanded all data be released. But the CNE website, where that data is usually published, went dark [  ] (and as of this article being published is still not working). Karen Rojas, 26, a Venezuelan living in Medellin, openly wept at an election results party attended by PWS. “The worst part is I allowed myself to hope against my better judgment,” she said. “I should have known nothing would change.” She worried her brother, still in Táchira, Venezuela, would end up hurt. “Protests will start tomorrow,” she said. “I’ve lived through that before. I’ve seen what police do.” Pirate Wire Services is a reader-supported publication.

In the morning, cacerolazos, Latin American pot-banging protests, echoed across the country. By the afternoon, police and protesters were openly clashing. Venezuelan journalist Titi González posted a video [  of a panoramic view of western Caracas —once a stronghold of Chavismo— full of smoke from the spontaneous protests and subsequent clashes. It looked like a warzone. ] of a panoramic view of western Caracas —once a stronghold of Chavismo— full of smoke from the spontaneous protests and subsequent clashes. It looked like a warzone. By late afternoon, protesters had surrounded Miraflores, where the presidential palace is located in Caracas, where the openly clashed with police. The government of Mauro found itself staring down something it has never faced before, a real revolution of the barrios. In the past, the response of security forces to social unrest has been absolutely brutal. Between 2015 and 2017, Venezuelan security forces killed 19,000 people [  ] for “resisting arrest” according to Human Rights Watch. Venezuela has a population of 28 million people. For comparison, in the United States, which has a population of over 300 million, police killed just over 1,000 people in 2023. At 6 p.m. on Monday, as protests raged on, opposition leader María Corina Machado gave a press conference in which she claimed to have proof of election fraud [  ]. With 73% of votes counted, she said, the results showed that opposition presidential candidate González Urrutia was the true victor of Sunday’s elections. By nightfall, multiple reports of colectivos (social groups set up by Hugo Chávez which also sometimes serve as militia enforcers of the government) attacking protesters flooded social media. Protesters had also blocked major highways as well as the airport in Caracas. In just 24 hours, the country had gone from hope to heartbreak, to active resistance on the streets against a security apparatus well-known for its brutality. What comes next is anyone’s guess. As we write these words, Venezuela’s future is uncertain. A major and violent crackdown is a distinct possibility. We at PWS very much hope that dark prediction doesn’t come to fruition. But we also fear that it very well may.

The main opposition candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia received 44.2 percent, with 80 percent of voting stations counted. The results set Maduro up for a third presidential term, that would last until 2031. There were widespread reports of irregularities and voter intimidation throughout the day yesterday. Opposition leaders said their monitors were kicked out of polling stations and denounced irregularities with vote tallies. (Efecto Cocuyo [  ], Runrun.es [  ]) Electoral authorities made the announcement eight hours after polls closed, a delay they ascribed to sabotage. (Caracas Chronicles [  ]) Speaking last night, Maduro praised his country’s electoral system, describing it as one with a “very high level of trust, security, transparency.” He also said the system was the target of a failed “massive hack” by a foreign actor, which he refused to identify. (Associated Press [  ]) Opposition parties immediately challenged the results, saying the contradicted data they had received earlier in the day from the electoral agency, before it halted information sharing abruptly, which showed Gonzalez with 70 percent of the vote compared to 30 percent for Maduro. (Miami Herald [  ]) Following the electoral authorities’ announcement after midnight, opposition leader María Corina Machado declared González the real winner of the election. She said the electoral authority announcement is not credible given these earlier results, and also cited exit polls from reputable firms that contradict the electoral authority announcement. (Efecto Cocuyo [  ], Runrun.es [  ], Reuters [  ]) Opposition leaders say electoral officials’ refusal to release paper tallies of the electronic vote in many polling places. Venezuelan electoral law guarantees access to the paper printout of each electronic voting machine’s final tally. But so far opposition monitors have only obtained 40 percent of these tallies. Without these paper counts, the results cannot be verified. (New York Times [  ] and New York Times [  ]) Machado asked election observers and supporters to remain at voting centers until all voting records arrive. (Washington Post [  ]) González said early this morning that his campaign will not rest until the Venezuelan people’s will is respected, but it was not immediately clear what his strategy would be. He said he was not calling people out onto the streets. (Efecto Cocuyo [  ], Associated Press [  ]) Though it was always considered unlikely that the Maduro government would simply cede power, Venezuelans expressed a strong desire for change during the campaign, which fanned optimistic expectations that Venezuela’s fractious opposition, which had mustered a united front against a Chavista government, could successfully force a democratic transition via ballot boxes. Citizens were motived after years of political apathy, and Venezuela’s election day effectively started the night before polls opened in many places, as people camped in line to vote. The government sought to quash the swell of opposition support by suppressing voters, organizing polling stations to ensure long lines, moving polling places at the last minute, limiting voting hours, and, in other cases, extending voting times in areas where officials rounded up pro-government votes. The Washington Post [  ] reports violence in some polling centers: “when opposition supporters at the Liceo Andrés Bello in Caracas complained of being denied access to the vote count, a colectivo — a gang of at least 150 Maduro supporters on motorbikes — arrived shouting pro-government chants … the men, hooded and wearing black, begin to punch and kick those outside the polling center, injuring multiple people.” International Reactions The lack of credible results means “Venezuela is facing a new political blockade,” reports El País [  ]. “The presidential election was the result of a secret agreement between the United States and the Chavista government in Qatar, and viewed by the international community as a way of leading the country towards a democratic normality.” Though regional allies, Cuba, Bolivia and Honduras congratulated Maduro on his second reelection, a number of countries called for a more transparent vote tabulation or called outright fraud. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said his government had “serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people.” (Guardian [  ]) Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, tweeted: “Maduro’s regime must understand that the results it has published are hard to believe … Chile will not recognize any result that is not verifiable.” Colombia joined calls for a total vote count, while Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo said the country received the official results “with many doubts. This is why electoral observation mission reports are essential, and today more than ever, must defend Venezuelans\\' votes.\" (Reuters [  ]) Germany [  ] this morning called “all for the publication of detailed results for all polling stations & access to all voting and election documents for opposition and observers.” And the European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said “Ensuring full transparency in the electoral process, including detailed counting of votes and access to voting records at polling stations, is vital.\" Costa Rica, Peru and Uruguay all rejected what they characterized as a fraudulent vote count. Peru announced it had recalled its ambassador to Venezuela for consultation over the election results. (AFP [  ]) Ahead of the election results, Argentina’s president Javier Milei called on Venezuela’s Armed Forces to defend democracy. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday congratulated Maduro this morning. (Reuters [  ]) Migration Venezuelan migrants became more likely to be in an irregular status as a result of the implementation of visa restrictions on Venezuela across South America, according to a paper [  ] at World Development, explaining, “The introduction of visa restrictions and consequent situation of migratory irregularity shifted migrants’ priorities, mainly away from seeking employment, likely delaying their integration.” (Americas Migration Brief [  ]) Trump vs. Biden on immigration: 12 charts comparing U.S. border security — Washington Post [  ] Mexico Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called for “transparency” after the sudden arrests of Sinaloa Cartel leaders Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García and Joaquín Guzmán López in the U.S. last week. “The nature of the arrests will shape the fallout in Mexico, where the suggestion of a betrayal within the Sinaloa cartel could be explosive,” reports the Guardian [  ]. (See last Friday’s briefs [  ].) “It is still unclear how the events unfolded. Several sources within the US government, who had knowledge of the operation but were not authorized to speak on the matter, told InSight Crime [  ] the pair orchestrated their handover to US authorities.” “Inasmuch as the Sinaloa cartel is a multinational corporate success, El Mayo is at once the co-founding CEO and the chief finance officer.” But it’s just the latest example of a failed policy targeting criminal kingpins “on the premise that the best way to undermine a cartel is to decapitate it,” writes Ed Vulliamy in the Guardian [  ].

But researcher John R. Hutchinson, who spends a lot of time researching large animals' locomotion, reveals [ that hippos move such fast speeds that they can become airborne - with all four feet off the ground at once. The ceasefire brokered by the US to enable humanitarian assistance to reach some of the 7 million people displaced by conflict in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a welcome step. Delphin Ntayoma, however, argues [ that lasting peace in the DRC requires addressing the conflict's underlying causes. South Africans have the lowest savings - as a percentage of GDP - globally and among their peers in emerging markets. The government wants to raise the household savings rate and has introduced significant reforms to the retirement system, effective from 1 September this year. Economist Adrian Saville will analyse [ these changes and their implications in a four-part series starting today. Natasha Joseph Commissioning Editor Hippos don’t fly - but the massive animals can get airborne [ John R. Hutchinson, Royal Veterinary College This shows that hippos are one of the largest animals that still can get airborne at fast speeds and yet they are also adapted for an aquatic lifestyle. DRC ceasefire for humanitarian aid is a small step forward - what must happen next for peace [ Delphin R. Ntanyoma, University of Leeds Temporary ceasefire should be seen more broadly as a window to further engage with all parties to find long-term solutions. South Africa is changing its retirement rules to help boost country savings: how it will work [ Adrian Saville, University of Pretoria South Africa is making improvements to repair the country’s weak state of saving.

Tensions in the country are rising as Maduro trails in most polls to opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia [  ]. The government denied entry into the country to some international election observers. It also closed the land border with Colombia on Thursday, leaving many Venezuelans from the eastern state of Mérida trapped in Cúcuta [  ]. Current President Nicolas Maduro, who took power in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chávez, is facing the greatest challenge to his power in his career. His popularity has plummeted over the last decade as the country plunged into economic and political crisis. Eight million people have fled the country since 2014. Police crackdowns in the country have left nearly 20,000 people dead [  ], killings that peaked in 2017, and hundreds of people have been jailed for their political affiliations. Given the presence of international observers, and the security of vote-counting software, outright fraud, if it happens, will be traceable. But that doesn’t mean there won’t be hijinks. Voter suppression efforts are already underway. Despite agreements as part of the Barbados Accords, agreements between the government and opposition representatives, voter rolls have not been updated, and the vast majority of Venezuelans abroad, nearly 25% of the country’s population, will not be able to participate in elections. But despite polling, Maduro has been projecting confidence in recent weeks, saying at a rally on Thursday that his party will win “by hook or by crook”. The government is relying on massive turn-out-the-vote operations among supporters. Today’s feature will be a little different.

The election is neither free nor fair, Nicolás Maduro’s government has engaged in years of political repression, and drastically limited independent media and civil society. Nonetheless, it is the most significant challenge to Maduro’s hold on power in nearly a decade. It is the first time since 2015 that the most important opposition parties are participating in a national election, and polls give the opposition Plataforma Unida Democrática coalition an important advantage. Candidates closed their campaigns yesterday. Edmundo González Urrutia, a relatively unknown retired diplomat, is the surprise unity candidate for the opposition. He has campaigned alongside poll leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running for office. In a video Maduro said that only he could \"guarantee peace and stability,\" while Gonzñalez Urrutia urged Venezuelans to not let \"the message of hate... intimidate you.\" (AFP [  ]) Neither Free nor Fair Though González and Machado have been permitted to campaign, the Maduro government has arrested over a hundred people in politically motivated cases, most associated with the PUD campaign and 72 since the beginning of the campaign on July 4, according to Foro Penal. (Human Rights Watch [  ]) Advocacy groups estimate nearly 290 people are detained nationwide for political reasons. In addition to political repression, the government has intensified constraints against independent media and organizations of civil society. And electoral authorities have sought to stack the deck in favor of Maduro, from a questionable ballot design to reducing ballot boxes in polling stations in order to slow down voting and complicate monitoring. (Reuters [  ], Reuters [  ], Reuters [  ]) Additionally, Maduro has leveraged alliances with criminal actors, part of the regime’s “hybrid criminal governance model,” reports InSight Crime [  ]. “Maduro’s government has not hesitated to deploy its criminal allies when threatened in the past. In the lead up to the elections, state security forces and non-state armed groups (NSAGs) have cooperated to intimidate opposition candidates and suppress their supporters.” There will be limited international observation of the election — in May Venezuelan electoral authorities rescinded an invitation to European Union observers. The Carter Center will be present and the UN will send an Electoral Technical Team. (Human Rights Watch [  ]) However, the opposition coalition has recruited volunteers to observe 98% of polling stations, reports the Washington Post [  ]. Brazil’s top electoral court announced it was cancelling an observation mission after critical comments about its electoral system from Maduro and, former Argentine President Alberto Fernández said he was asked to cancel his plans to observe the election after warning Maduro that he must leave power if losing the election. Fernández essentially paraphrased a statement by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva who voiced concern after Maduro warned that an electoral loss would lead to a “bloodbath.” (Bloomberg [  ], Buenos Aires Times [  ]) The U.S. government voiced concern yesterday about the threat of violence in the and warned Maduro of the need to hold a fair vote free of political repression or intimidation. (Reuters [  ]) International pressure, from the United States, Brazil and Colombia has been key in ensuring the election thus far, and advocates say foreign governments’ reactions to Sunday’s outcome will be key. Scenarios There are several potential scenarios for the election: a) Maduro wins; b) the government steals the election; c) Maduro concedes defeat; d) no results are announced immediately. (Caracas Chronicles [  ]) Most serious polling puts González far ahead of Maduro, by as much as 20 to 30 points. But some analysts temper this finding. Pollsters have erred in favor of the opposition in elections since 2017, notes David Smilde in Responsible Statecraft [  ], due to factors that include outdated census information, and the extraordinary pressure exerted by the government to ensure turnout among its voters. Massive fraud will be evident because the electronic voting machines have been audited and because of the poll witness at voting centers. “One possible scenario would be long delays in announcing the results — something that with electronic machines should be available quickly. Extended delays will suggest that the government is losing and is figuring out what to do. The government may try to disqualify results from certain centers, candidates or parties to ensure Maduro comes out on top. Or it could concede defeat. Despite all it has to lose, this scenario is not impossible. Even if it loses the presidency, Chavismo will still control the other branches of government, and there are five long months between the election and the investiture in January 2025, during which agreements could be forged.” Opposition unity has been a key factor in the campaign, and a Chatham House [  ] report notes that there have been benefits to participating in elections even where conditions are suboptimal. “Over time, when the opposition participated in elections, as it did in 2015 and 2021, it reclaimed electoral power and space. In 2015, opposition parties won a majority in the national assembly elections, though the supreme electoral tribunal stole a supermajority from them. In 2021, they gained municipal and state seats in regional and local elections.” In defense of polling, Delphos director Félix Seijas Rodríguez notes that the gap between opposition supporters and chavistas has never been greater, and could overcome government efforts to suppress turnout and “slice away” at opposition voters. The hope of the opposition is that the vote will be “too big to steal.” (Americas Quarterly [  ]) Among the many potential outcomes, “a clearly fraudulent result would likely trigger street protests,” according to an Atlantic Center [  ] memo. “As in previous protest waves in 2014, 2017, and 2019, this may lead to clashes with security forces, but the prospect of these mobilizations forcing a change in government is highly unlikely. All eyes will be on Machado to gauge how she would react to low turnout or electoral fraud, and what each would mean for the prospect of unrest. The security forces will likely be reluctant to engage in massive repression on the scale seen in the 2014 and 2017 protests, given how this fueled international condemnation and the investigation of International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan.” Most analysts concur that any possibility of a transition will require a negotiated offramp for Maduro and allies, in particular immunity from prosecution. Many have called on international actors to support such a negotiation ahead of the elections. “In a transition scenario, the key takeaway is that a González win won’t just be handed to him, even in the best-case scenario. It comes with challenges and concessions,” argues James Bosworth [  ]. “My base case (60% likely) is that Maduro successfully steals the election and then represses the protests afterward and navigates the international criticism that comes his way. I’m estimating that the odds of transition are 25%. The remaining 15% of scenarios are some form of post-election chaos and violence.” (Latin America Risk Report [  ]) According to one source cited in the Financial Times [  ]: “The best-case scenario is that the government pauses the count in the event of an opposition victory, and starts negotiating.” More Venezuela Reuters [  ] has a timeline of Maduro’s time in power. The UNHCR estimates that more than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America’s recent history — the vast majority cannot vote in Sunday’s election. (Associated Press [  ]) Venezuela’s climate and energy policies are also at stake in Sunday’s election, writes Luisa Palacios in Americas Quarterly [  ]. Migration A U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimate predicts that increased immigration to the U.S. is expected to drive higher economic growth and labor supply, grow federal revenues and shrink deficits over the next 10 years, reports Axios [  ]. The report focuses on people who cannot legally work in the US, a group that “is expected to “generate $1.175 trillion in increased federal revenue in the 2024-2034 period and $270 billion in mandatory outlays and net federal spending for a net decrease of $897 billion in the federal deficit,” reports The Hill [  ]. Regional Legendary Sinaloa Cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García was arrrested at a private airport in Texas. Zambada has evaded jail and had a $15 million bounty on his head. Authorities also detained Joaquín Guzmán López, one of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s sons, reports El País [  ]. Initial accounts suggest it was a betrayal by the younger Guzmán, reports the New York Times [  ]. Zambada García “was unaware he was headed to the United States when he boarded a private airplane with Mr. Guzmán López, who told him they were going to look at some real estate properties, according to two American law enforcement officials who were briefed on the situation.” But others dispute this account and say Zambada García cut a deal with U.S. law enforcement, according to Ioan Grillo: “I have issues with both explanations. On one side, I find it hard to accept that Mayo with his vast experience and status would need to go on a plane to inspect crops and fall into U.S. hands. But on the other, a deal for Mayo could be tricky as he is at the top level so it would be hard to make him a witness on a bigger target.” (CrashOut [  ]) “The charges are part of a crackdown on Sinaloa cartel leaders,” reports the Guardian [  ]. “Last year, the US justice department charged more than two dozen members of the Sinaloa cartel, including the sons of notorious drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, accusing them of supplying precursor chemicals required to make fentanyl.” Don’t try this at home: Reuters [  ] investigators purchased the ingredients needed to make $3 million worth of fentanyl online for just $3,600. Nearly 600 people fled to Guatemala from their homes in southern Mexico, fleeing cartel violence. Two of Mexico’s most powerful cartels have been battling for control of smuggling routes in the area for more than a year causing multiple displacements, reports the Associated Press [  ]. Regional Relations The U.S. should ensure Mexico does not turn to China by upgrading the two countries’ relationship to a “strategic partnership,” argue Ryan Berg and Connor Pfeiffer in Foreign Policy [  ]. Critter Corner “An Andean condor being treated in Chile with lead in its blood, a pellet embedded in its skull and a satellite tracker from Argentina highlights the challenges of conserving this endangered bird,” reports Reuters [  ].

India’s imports from China have more than doubled since the Covid epidemic. China’s export prowess is a magnet that realigns all of Asia’s economies around its economic sphere.  ** China quietly taking the lead in climate diplomacy ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Xu Yi-Chong China is emerging as a global leader in climate diplomacy, advancing initiatives to combat climate change while promoting green technologies. Through strategic international collaborations and investments in renewable energy, Beijing is positioning itself at the forefront of global climate efforts, challenging traditional Western dominance in this critical arena.  ** ------------------------------------------------------------ ** Nvidia challenger working with South Korea and Japan ------------------------------------------------------------ Subscribe to AT+ Premium ( to read the latest from Scott Foster, who writes that Canadian company Tenstorrent is collaborating with South Korea and Japan to challenge Nvidia. This partnership involves working with Samsung, Hyundai Motor, and Rapidus to develop cost-effective AI technologies, potentially disrupting the AI chip market.  ** No need for an Asian NATO to counter China ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Daniel R. DePetris The idea of forming an \"Asian NATO\" to counter China’s rise is unnecessary and potentially destabilizing. Regional security can be effectively maintained through existing alliances and partnerships. Strengthening economic ties and diplomatic engagement, rather than military blocs, is a more sustainable approach to addressing the challenges posed by China’s growing influence.  ** Can Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump? ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Bill Emmott As the 2024 election looms, the question arises: can Kamala Harris defeat Donald Trump? Harris faces the challenge of solidifying her base while appealing to swing voters. Her campaign strategy, public perception, and the political climate will play crucial roles in determining whether she can secure a victory against the former president. She has a good chance of doing so.  ** US targets Hong Kong chip transshipments to Russia ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Jeff Pao The United States is cracking down on Hong Kong\\'s role in transshipping semiconductors to Russia, aiming to tighten sanctions and prevent technology transfer. China and Hong Kong, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are among the countries of concern that are sourcing computer numeric control (CNC) machine tools for Russia, according to a Washington-based non-profit.  ** China cuts key rate amid worst deflation since ’99 ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By William Pesek Pan Gongsheng isn’t famed for acrobatic skills. But on Monday, the People’s Bank of China governor embarked on a routine that will test his monetary balance, agility and motor coordination in tantalizing ways. The PBOC’s move to cut a key short-term policy rate for the first time in almost a year surprised many traders as Beijing moves to avoid a prolonged deflationary spiral.   ** Israel, Hezbollah teeter toward regional conflagration ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Amin Saikal Rising tensions between Israel and Hezbollah are pushing the region toward a potential conflict. Recent clashes and rhetoric indicate escalating hostilities that could draw in neighboring countries and destabilize the Middle East. The situation underscores the fragile balance of power and the risk of broader regional warfare.  ** Anti-colonial call to cancel US RIMPAC naval exercises ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Kate Lewis Hood There is a growing anti-colonial movement demanding the cancellation of the US-led RIMPAC naval exercises. Activists argue that these exercises symbolize ongoing colonialism and militarization, particularly in the Pacific region.

I’m back from a road trip and will hopefully get back on track with regular newsletter writing in the coming weeks. For World Politics Review, I wrote about Lula vs Milei [  ]. Here are some Venezuela comments plus this week’s reading list. Venezuela comments Once turnout factors are modeled in, I estimate that Edmundo González has a 10-15 point lead in the race. This race is about 54-42 in favor of the opposition. That gap means the opposition is nearly certain (>95%) to turn out more voters than the governing party. The question is then how the votes are counted. The gap means the governing party will need to engage in both mesa-level ballot stuffing and some sort of manipulation of the count to pull off an announced victory, and that fraud should be obvious to international observers. Opposition witnesses should have proof that the vote is stolen. My base case (60% likely) is that Maduro successfully steals the election and then represses the protests afterward and navigates the international criticism that comes his way. I’m estimating that the odds of transition are 25%. The remaining 15% of scenarios are some form of post-election chaos and violence. The odds of a transition at 25% are high, up from 15% a few months ago, but not as high as they were in 2019 at the start of the Guaidó push. Maduro is in a stronger place than he was in 2019. Getting to odds that are better than an inside straight draw in poker is proof of how well Machado and the opposition have run this campaign. They still need a whole lot to go correct to succeed. If the question comes down to “will González/Machado do the right thing?” in a critical moment in the coming weeks, I think the answer is most certainly yes. The Biden administration is also smart enough to make the right moves if the opportunity presents itself. Whether this transition happens is now up to Maduro, the military, and the inner circle of Chavistas. In a transition scenario, the key takeaway is that a González win won’t just be handed to him, even in the best-case scenario. It comes with challenges and concessions. The process will go well beyond Sunday night. These sorts of transitions are about the post-election negotiations after the votes are cast and those can take days. Even if Maduro successfully steals this election, as is the most likely scenario, the opposition should be proud to have built a real political movement that quite possibly has staying power. The worst thing the opposition can do is fall into a post-election cycle of despair and self-criticism. Maintain some momentum and good things can happen in the next 12-18 months.

2024 [ Kenya’s athletes are world famous - and none more so right now than Faith Kipyegon. The case for her being the greatest 1,500m athlete in recorded history will be made even stronger if, as expected, she lifts gold at the Paris Olympics on 10 August - making her the first to win the event in three consecutive games. But Kenya must strive for continued success. As distance running medals become more and more contested, the country will need to adapt and advance its pool of talent. Sports scientist Wycliffe W. Njororai Simiyu outlines [ seven key ways to do this. Kenya’s President William Ruto has appointed new figures to cabinet. The new finance minister must find solutions to high sovereign debt, youth unemployment and entrenched corruption - all in the midst of mounting public anger at the government.

While I extend my heartfelt hopes and best wishes to Venezuela’s opposition, and applaud the courage and character with which Maria Corina Machado, Edmundo Gonzalez and the rest of the opposition has run the present unprecedented electoral campaign…I argue that the Maduro regime has every incentive to steal or postpone the election, or undermine its outcome, in order to avoid the feared consequences of criminal prosecution that could come with losing power. Every action it has taken in the past 25 years of political struggle to capture and dominate Venezuela’s institutions are consistent with such a course. Everything in its past experience in facing down major protests in 2007, 2014, 2017, and 2019-2020 lead it to calculate that a combination of repression and terror by state organs such as SEBIN and the FAES, and unofficially, through collectivos, gangs and other agents, will eventually dissipate even the most massive protest. Their lessons of 25 years is that military and other elites complicit in the regime’s corruption are more afraid of a return to accountability, than they may be disgusted with Chavismo, and that even with some discontents the deep penetration of Cuban agents in security forces prevents any revolt from growing far. Past practice convinces them they have every reason to believe they can weather the worst sanctions and threats the US, the EU and others can throw at them, and that there is no “off-ramp” the gringos can offer them that is less risky than hunkering down. This work looks at what is likely to transpire in the coming days in Venezuela, and thus, the responses to be thinking about now, before it possibly occurs… The work is available for download here in English: It is available for download here in Spanish: The English-language version is available from Indrastra, which published it, at:  The Spanish-language version is available from Infobae, which translated and published it:  Podcasts, Media Appearances, and Radio Shows: As always, I would also like to share with you my latest weekly segments on the John Batchelor Show, in his special ongoing series on Latin America, The New World Report.

In Journal of Democracy [  ], Paola Bautista de Aleman assesses four reasons why opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia could win the election despite concerns over a free and fair voting process, citing a unified strength the opposition has not had in years, and a strong citizen desire for change. In Americas Quarterly [  ], pollster Félix Seijas Rodríguez notes how polls ahead of Sunday’s election are strongly inclined towards an opposition victory, in contrast to previous elections where the ruling Chavista movement was heavily favored. As Caracas Chronicles reports [  ], more and more women are playing prominent roles in Venezuelan politics, despite the predominant machista culture in the country. María Corina Machado, leader of the opposition movement, declared that she and opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia would be “willing to ensure a peaceful transition” and engage in negotiations with the Maduro administration in the event of an electoral victory, according to El País [  ]. The Wall Street Journal [  ] chronicles how the Venezuelan government is targeting dissidents not only within the country’s borders, but those living in entirely different countries, as well. The U.S. Institute of Peace [  ] outlines various roles the U.S. could play in reaching a solution to Venezuela’s multiple crises and achieving a peaceful and effective transition of power in the country. Reuters [  ] profiles Maria Corina Machado, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition whose presidential candidacy was disqualified following a ban on holding public office for 15 years by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court. In a new Wilson Center [  ] policy brief, Francisco Monaldi outlines how U.S. sanctions are impacting Venezuela’s oil industry, and argues that the U.S. should continue its “pragmatic” policy of licenses for foreign oil companies to operate in Venezuela, regardless of the electoral outcome, to help boost oil production. Brazil Nine ministries and two other federal agencies were the targets of a hacker attack in Brazil last night, according to Folha [  ]. There is still no defined timeline for the restoration of the affected systems, which included the ministries of Management, Finance, Indigenous Peoples, Planning and Budget, Development, Industry, Commerce and Services, Entrepreneurship, Micro and Small Business, Social Security, Racial Equality, Women, the Brazilian Mint, and Coaf (Financial Activities Control Council). Regional Relations The Brazilian Report [  ] notes the potential shift in Brazil-Venezuela relations under Brazilian President Lula, as Lula demonstrated a closeness to Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, reversing the antagonistic posture of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The outcome of Sunday’s elections in Venezuela, however, could affect the relationship between the two countries. Energy Bolivia has begun receiving oil and refined products from Russia amid a fuel shortage, highlighting Russia’s expansion across the region, reports Reuters [  ]. Brazil, Venezuela, Jamaica, and Cuba are also recipients of Russian fuel. The outcome of Venezuela’s elections have the potential to significantly impact global energy transition and climate goals, considering the country’s large oil supply, despite decades of mismanagement of the sector, writes Luisa Palacios in Americas Quarterly [  ]. There is also the possibility that the elections result in a lifting of U.S. sanctions on the sector, which would improve productivity. Mexico A decline in domestic crude supply, with supply at its lowest amount in over four decades, may impede Mexico’s goal of achieving energy independence as it may be forced to import crude from other countries, says Reuters [  ]. Last week, Mexico city almost unanimously passed a law to address and criminalize transfemicide, or the killing of a trans woman because of her gender, a crime accompanied by a prison sentence of up to 70 years, reports the Guardian [  ]. The decision represents a “watershed” moment for the country and the region. Archaeologist-turned-forensic scientist Roxana Enríquez Farias, through the Mexican Forensic Anthropology Team, helps lead the search for the bodies of those disappeared over the course of Mexico’s history, filling a gap that has been left by the federal government, writes Amy Reed-Sandoval in the New Yorker [  ]. In Foreign Policy [  ], Connor Pfeiffer and Ryan Berg argue that the U.S. should see Mexico as a strategic partner in the region and internationally, especially as the northern country seeks to curtail China’s regional and global influence. Argentina Argentina’s “CC” rating from credit rating agency Fitch indicates that the company believes “a restructuring or default of some kind on the bonds” is likely, despite President Javier Milei’s assurances to the contrary, says MercoPress [  ]. According to the Buenos Aires Times [  ], cryptocurrency usage in Argentina is incredibly high, given the country’s economic and social factors, including limited accessibility to foreign currency. A Forbes [  ] study indicated that “Argentina has the highest cryptocurrency adoption rate of any country in the Western Hemisphere.” Milei will arrive in France today to meet with his counterpart and attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, reports AP news [  ]. The meeting between the two heads of state will likely include a discussion over recent racist chants by the Argentine national soccer team, aimed towards the French.

But there’s far more richness to Madagascar’s fauna than the iconic lemurs. Madagascar is a biodiversity wonderland. Scientists estimate that about 85% of its animal species and 90% of its plant species are endemic, meaning they aren’t found anywhere else in the world. Its marine and aquatic ecosystems are equally rich in diversity - including a newly discovered species of long-nosed skate that, writes [ Simon Weigmann, has only been found in the Madagascar Ridge, a remote, elevated area of seabed south of the island. We’ve also previously published articles about Madagascar’s tiny frogs [ (the smallest of which is just longer than a grain of rice) and its giant tortoises [ as well as fossil finds that explain Madagascar’s central role in the story of chameleons [ and baobab trees [ Natasha Joseph Commissioning Editor New fish found off Madagascar: remarkable long-nosed skate discovered in the deep ocean [ Simon Weigmann, Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity Change The skate is found in deep waters and it’s not clear how fisheries might threaten the species. Baobab trees all come from Madagascar – new study reveals that their seeds and seedlings floated to mainland Africa and all the way to Australia [ Andrew R. Leitch, Queen Mary University of London New research has found that the world’s baobab trees all evolved on Madagascar 21 million years ago. Sometime in the last 12 million years, they floated on piles of debris to Australia and Africa. What Madagascar’s amazing mini creatures tell us about evolution [ Mark D. Scherz, Technical University Braunschweig Madagascar stands out as an exceptionally interesting place in which to study the evolution of “mini” creatures. And we are only just starting to scratch the surface of this. Putting the bones of giant, extinct ‘thunderbirds’ under the microscope reveals how they grew [ Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan, University of Cape Town The findings have repercussions today: it is clear that slow-growing animals will be the most vulnerable to extinction amid shifting climates. Kenyan fossil shows chameleons may have ‘rafted’ from mainland Africa to Madagascar [ Andrej Čerňanský, Comenius University, Bratislava This fossil find provides strong evidence of an African origin for some Malagasy chameleon lineages.

Today, here’s a look at what the world — and it is mostly the world, we’ve got little word from inside Vietnam just yet — is saying following the death of Nguyen Phu Trong last week. A lot of reviewing his legacy with a nervous eye to successions ahead. Support Dari Mulut ke Mulut by upgrading today ( I am really looking forward to photo essays in the days to come and will happily share those next week. See you tomorrow for a huge list of all the best things I read this month. Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— View image: ( Caption: Trong at the Putin visit in Hanoi last month, one of his last public outings Nguyen Phu Trong is dead at 80. The late secretary-general of Vietnam’s Communist Party had the kind of life that so many of the region’s elder-statespeople have — in some ways, his life’s story is that of his country’s. [According to Nikkei Asia’s fantastic obituary]( Trong was born in 1944 when Vietnam was still a French colony but occupied by Japan. He joined the Party during the Vietnam War and ‘studied party-building and literature before devoting his career to communism.’ He worked his way up the ranks before taking the top job in 2011. He was eventually given an unprecedented third term as secretary-general. This obituary lists Trong’s three major legacies off the bat — a new era of fruitful relations with the US, striking a balance with neighbouring China and kicking the anti-corruption campaign, or ‘burning furnace,’ into gear. This is a good framework, so let’s work through it. Vietnam has been increasingly important to the US, particularly in securing manufacturing and production security amid its own rivalry with China. [Rebecca Tan for the Washington Post]( notes this extends to security as the geo-political situation remains fraught. ‘Vietnam has sought to use Washington as a counterweight to Beijing, especially in the face of increased Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, which is claimed in part by Vietnam,’ Tan writes. View image: ( Caption: Trong, Trump and Ho Chi Minh in 2019 Vietnam doesn’t exactly see itself the same way — it is a sovereign nation, after all — but has been quick to take advantage. US President Joe Biden made a visit to Hanoi last year pledging friendship and business, but it’s a [switch in market status that Vietnam wants]( A decision from the US is expected by the end of the month. China’s politburo is mourning a “good comrade, brother and friend,” [the Guardian reports]( of Chinese state media. Vietnam’s ‘bamboo diplomacy,’ which is flexible and bendy, but never breaks, has ensured the country has managed to maintain relations with China even as it buddies up with the US. ‘Xi recalled that over the past decade, he and Trong had maintained close contact and developed a deep camaraderie, and that last year, they jointly announced the elevation of bilateral relations to a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance, a milestone in bilateral ties,’ [China Daily reports]( That great Nikkei read notes that ‘Trong's unrivalled Marxist-Leninist bona fides’ had helped him establish a very tight working relationship with Xi Jinping, who rose to his role just a year after Trong and similarly was extended an unheard-of third term. Over at Fulcrum, Le Hong Hiep and Nguyen Khac Giang were ready to go! This excellent piece looks at Trong’s long legacy dropped before the NYT push notification. As we know and love about Fulcrum, this is far more in-depth than the immediate news analysis and traces Trong’s history as a savvy political player, outwitting his way up the Politburo. ‘As the CPV’s top leader, Trong’s main job is to maintain the Party’s survival and ultimately its hold on power. As such, he often adopted a hardline approach towards perceived threats to regime security,’ the pair write. This explains the strengthening of government institutions, including the Ministry of Public Security, in rooting out corruption in the ranks and a renewed ‘emphasis on revitalising ideology as a means of preventing moral decay among party members.’ But it may not have played out exactly how he had hoped: ‘Trong’s consolidation of power during his anti-corruption crusade had the unexpected consequence of undermining the very institutions he sought to strengthen,’ they write. The pair suggest that the ‘dominance’ of Trong’s leadership saw power centralise within the Politburo and himself specifically ‘thereby weakening the Central Committee and undermining the principle of collective leadership.’ How this works out in the coming years will certainly be interesting to watch. [President To Lam]( who rose to the post only a month ago after predecessor Vo Van Thuong was ousted as a major scalp in the anti-corruption drive, has been named temporary general-secretary. To Lam had been running the very powerful Ministry of Public Security prior to the shake-up. I’m not sure if we can say he is ‘widely expected’ to hold on to the gen-sec role after the enormous congress due in 2026, but I am confident in saying no one would be surprised if he did. We might be looking at a different political landscape entirely, Gregory Poling says in this CSIS Q&A, and that makes any prediction tough. ‘Even less clear than who succeeds Trong is whether they will command the same influence. It seems unlikely that any of the leading contenders will command the degree of cross-factional respect that Trong did. If others could easily bridge those divides, Trong would not have been seen as the indispensable man and kept in power for so long. The intraparty struggles and horse trading will be kept from outsiders, rendering any odds-making in the 2026 leadership contest little more than a guessing game.’ Let’s just get through the week first. Vietnam is officially in a state of mourning as of today ahead of tomorrow’s state funeral in Hanoi. Flags are at half-mast and, as [Mike Tatarski spotted in his Vietnam Weekly]( this morning, news sites have gone greyscale. Communists have a great state funeral aesthetic, but there is that edge of menace we often find in Vietnam. Three Facebook users in Saigon have been fined for spreading ‘untrue news’ about Trong’s death, [RFA reports citing Vietnamese news]( ‘In the days after Trong’s death, the Ho Chi Minh police's cyber security unit detected Vietnamese and foreign nationals using social media to post information deemed to be “unfounded” and intended “to destroy the national unity [and] to humiliate the party and state leaders’ dignity.”’ RFA reports. [There’s an aside in BBC’s report]( that I found interesting. It’s often difficult to get a straight story in Vietnam, but when it comes to Trong’s health over the last few months that is by design. A 2018 law reclassified the health of top officials as a state secret. ‘Intense speculation over his health has long thrived on social media,’ the outlet notes. This had reached fever pitch in recent months as he became a less reliable attendee at various state events. ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

The use of such lands to sell credits also contributes little to reducing carbon emissions.” “The Post’s investigation not only exposes failings in the global system for vetting such ventures but also calls into question the value of some projects in addressing global warming. Much of the Brazilian Amazon is safeguarded by a green shield of publicly protected lands: national forests, Indigenous territory, federal and state reserves. But when polluting companies buy credits generated by supposedly preserving land that was already protected, their money contributes next to nothing.” Regional Relations Nicaragua’s 2021 decision to shift diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China was aimed at alleviating the Ortega regime’s international isolation — but the move has brought limited tangible benefits, reports Americas Quarterly [  ]. “U.S. Southern Command Chief General Laura Richardson called on leaders in her country to devise some “Marshall Plan” in Latin America … which is highly necessary to neutralize Chinese and Russian influence in the region,” reports MercoPress [  ]. U.S. vice-president and presumptive Democratic Party presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ record on Latin America is checkered. Early on in Biden’s presidency she was tasked with tackling “root causes of migration,” an impossibly complex mission, according to France 24 [  ]. Migration A group of 2,000 migrants from dozens of countries set out on foot yesterday through southern Mexico as they attempt to reach the U.S. Recent attempts to travel by caravan have failed, notes the Associated Press [  ]. Mexico Thousands of people in Chiapas have been displaced by territorial disputes between armed groups in southern Mexico. “With the increase in mass migration through Chiapas to the U.S.-Mexico border, Tila has become an even more lucrative site for organized crime, with much of the southern area of the state currently contested by the Jalisco and Sinaloa cartels,” reports Nacla [  ].

Cuba Cuban leaders said illegal drug use and violent crime, once rare, are on the rise, in the midst of a crushing economic crisis. Speaking at a National Assembly session last week, President Miguel Díaz-Canel acknowledged that the government is no longer able to provide needed medicines or deliver in a timely manner “the few” food products that Cubans can still obtain through ration cards, reports the Miami Herald [  ]. (See yesterday’s briefs [  ].) As the number of vacant homes in Cuba increases due to emigration, a new profession of caretaking these empty properties has emerged. Despite the growing number of empty houses, the official stance has largely ignored the situation, while many Cubans live in overcrowded conditions, reports 14 y Medio [  ]. Venezuela As Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro faces his most significant political challenge in years on Sunday, the Washington Post [  ] reviews the timeline of his rule since 2013. Opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running, “has not only corralled Venezuela’s fractious opposition behind her, but has also captivated a broad swath of the electorate with a promise for sweeping government change,” reports the New York Times [  ]. “For the first time in decades, (Venezuelan) voters say they are willing to turn out to cast their ballots, a dramatic change from years of declining voter trust and participation in elections,” according to a Chatham House [  ] report. But “post-election upheaval is near inevitable.” WOLA [  ] emphasizes the post-electoral role of the international community. “Should the Maduro government recognize its defeat, negotiations will need to establish conditions for a transfer of power by January 2025. If the Maduro government claims victory despite evidence of irregularities or otherwise disregards the results, international actors are likely to issue a resounding condemnation of the election.” Close to 7.8 million Venezuelans — over one-quarter of the population — have left the country. But the government has placed significant barriers to prevent them from voting: Only 69,000 Venezuelans living abroad are registered. (The Conversation [  ]) Sky-high inflation has cooled somewhat in Venezuela, but salaries remain way behind food prices, adding to discontent strengthens the opposition challenge to Maduro’s government in Sunday’s presidential elections, reports Reuters [  ]. Even Hugo Chávez’s hometown has turned against his successor, according to the Financial Times. Dominican Republic Dominican activists protested against a new penal code that maintains a total ban on abortion, reduces penalties for marital sexual violence, and excludes protections for sexual orientation, reports the Associated Press [  ]. Argentina Argentina’s perennial economic woes undergird “the emergence of a unique society that runs on grit, ingenuity and opportunism — perhaps now more than ever as Argentina undergoes its worst economic crisis since its catastrophic foreign-debt default of 2001,” reports the Associated Press [  ]. Regional “Latin American drug networks are increasingly using unmanned vessels and employing new methods to chemically transform cocaine to move large drug shipments,” reports InSight Crime [  ]. Critter Corner Wild sharks off the coast of Brazil have tested positive for cocaine — though how they were exposed it remains a mystery, according to new study by Brazilian scientists.

The work reflects my conversations with a number of current and former senior Guatemalan officials, academics, and other analysts. The work emphasizes the importance of Guatemala and its effective, democratic governance to the security of the U.S. and the dynamics of the region, given Guatemala’s strategic location spanning the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, with key drug and migrant transit routes through the region, as well as Guatemala’s maintenance of formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the PRC expands its influence and activities with other governments in the area which are increasingly less disposed to work with the U.S. The work looks at the evolving patterns of drug transits, migrants and other activities related to transnational organized crime in Guatemala, as well as the evolution of the initiatives, institutions and assets of the Guatemalan National Police and Military, in partnership with the U.S. and others, in response to those challenges. The final academic version will be available in multiple languages in a forthcoming edition of the Journal of the Americas.

Ahead of Sunday’s watershed presidential election, “the self-proclaimed socialist is working harder than ever to shore up the loyalty of the armed forces — the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela — and keep top commanders in line,” reports the Associated Press [  ]. Venezuela’s government blocked access to five news sites yesterday, six days ahead of the July 28 presidential election: El Estímulo, Analítica, Runrun.es, Medianálisis, and TalCual were blocked. (El Pitazo [  ]) “Government control of the media and self-censorship has distorted election coverage in Venezuela and deprived voters of vital information about the presidential candidates,” reports the Committee to Protect Journalists [  ]. Though the electoral playing field is significantly tilted towards the government, opposition leader María Corina Machado is banking on an outpouring of popular support, she told El País [  ] in an interview. Brazil Brazil announced a plan to dramatically expand selective logging to an area the size of Costa Rica over the next two years, reports the Associated Press [  ]. The move is aimed at limiting illegal logging. Brazil’s Lula administration has failed to sufficiently protect Indigenous communities from land grabbers and ranchers, according to a new report by the Missionary Council for Indigenous Peoples (CIMI). The report details the alleged involvement of police in private militias that are being investigated for Indigenous deaths, reports Reuters [  ]. “Brazil\\'s economy will continue growing at a steady pace over the medium term thanks to a continuous rise in public spending that is set to keep fiscal deficits uncomfortably high,” according to Reuters [  ]. Cuba Cuba’s government said 10 percent of the country’s population — more than a million people — left the island between 2022 and 2023, the largest migration wave in Cuban history — Miami Herald [  ]. On a far smaller scale, a low birthrate and high number of deaths also contributed to a massive fall in Cuba’s population. Migration FT highlights the situation of Venezuelans living in the Brazilian border state of Roraima, noting that “it is not uncommon to hear complaints about occasional xenophobia, while some locals grumble about the impact on jobs and the cost of living,” and that “although the daily flow of people crossing the border has fallen, it is still around 350.” (Americas Migration Brief [  ]) Haiti The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations announced $60 million in additional humanitarian assistance to Haiti during a visit yesterday. (Associated Press [  ]) A Haitian judge charged 45 people with crimes related to the 2018 La Saline massacre — a an episode that “revealed an ugly truth — that Haitian gangs weren’t just ruthless, they were complicit with some government officials in their struggle for control and influence,” reports the Miami Herald [  ]. Mexico “Claudia Sheinbaum won Mexico’s presidential election thanks to her party’s record of passing universal social policies, respecting working-class voters, and rejecting biased media narratives,” writes Kurt Hackbarth in Jacobin [  ]. Argentina Argentine President Milei did not fall out of a coconut tree, argues Pablo Touzon in an essay for Compact [  ], challenging facile ideological categorizations of the outsider leader. Rather than a punishment, Milei is a consequence of a polarized “political system that served only to organize competition between left and right elites.” Milei assigned nearly $70 million in discretionary funds to a reorganized intelligence agency that depends directly on the presidency. (Página 12 [  ]) Argentina’s government has attempted to paint the visit by six ruling party lawmakers to convicted human rights criminals as a “personal decision,” but it forms part of a series of measures and discourses by government officials denying state terrorism under the country’s last dictatorship, reports El País [  ]. Regional Relations Milei has become an obstacle to Lula’s global diplomacy aspirations, argues James Bosworth in World Politics Review [  ]. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador paid tribute to his US counterpart Joe Biden after he abandoned his reelection bid, voicing hope for continued good relations with Washington, reports AFP [  ]. Regional Juan Villoro writes about the futbol rivalry between Mexico and the United States in Boom [  ]. Ecuador Illegal gold mining is the latest battleground in Ecuador’s protracted war on organized crime, writes Anastasia Austin in InSight Crime [  ]. “Ecuador\\'s navy is ready to protect the seas around the Galapagos Islands from illegal fishing by foreign ships whose annual visits threaten marine wildlife in the archipelago\\'s waters, following training exercises with neighboring allies,” reports Reuters [  ]. Critter Corner Colombian President Gustavo Petro enacted a law banning bullfighting, ending a practice that had been constitutionally recognized as part of the country\\'s culture.

They’ve edited the only vaccine against tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, making it more effective in limiting the growth of tuberculosis in the lungs of mice.

Only Manila can put on a show like that. Sure, a red carpet and gowns rivalling a Hollywood awards show can seem a bit naff for a State of the Nation Address, a little Hunger Games even. [But I’m a sucker for Heart Evangelista]( Thankfully, President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr’s speech was full of meaningful and insightful comments for us to crack into. Celebrate a SONA with a Dari Mulut ke Mulut upgrade ( The hard-working journalists and analysts of the Philippines will surely be spending today getting their post-SONA write-ups and commentary pieces together. I’m really looking forward to wading through those and seeing what the eagle-eyed and -eared have noted that the immediate response missed. See you Thursday for a jump over to Vietnam as preparations for a state funeral and power transition continue. Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— View image: ( Caption: Thanks to the PCO for the snap! ## POGOs are gone Or at least, Marcos wants them gone. All Philippine offshore gaming operators, better known by the acronym, will be booted from the country after years of controversy. This controversy hit an all-time high in recent months with the connection between disgraced (and missing) Tarlac mayor Alice Guo putting a renewed lens on the industry with deep links to Chinese criminal syndicates. “Disguising as legitimate entities, their operations have ventured into illicit areas furthest from gaming, such as financial scamming, money laundering, prostitution, human trafficking, kidnapping, brutal torture, even murder. The grave abuse and disrespect to our system of laws must stop,” Marcos said during the speech to cheers and applause from lawmakers in attendance. While POGOs have been declared illegal as of yesterday, state regulator Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp will work to have them all purged from the country by the end of the year, [Inquirer reports]( The Department of Labour and Employment has previously flagged around 25,000 Filipinos working in the industry. Marcos vowed to work with the department to retrain those left jobless to find employment elsewhere. This announcement was widely welcomed by watchers, but many have raised concerns already that this will be easier said than done. POGOs have operated in the country since the early 2000s before former president Rodrigo Duterte regulated the industry in the early days of his presidency. There are fears that criminal elements that control POGOs are connected to political elites and will surely attempt to fight back. I think, given the Alice Guo story and the alleged lengths she and her business partners and family have gone to maintain their interests in POGOs, that fear is well-founded. Also! These things just plain old suck. That’s a good enough to reason, in my view. But, it is very early days in this policy and Marcos Jr sure needs a boost in approval — this might be the way to do it. ## Standing ground in the West Philippine Sea “The Philippines cannot yield. The Philippines cannot waver,” Marcos Jr said of his position in the South China Sea. “The West Philippine Sea is not a figment of our imagination. It is ours. And it will remain ours as long as the spirit of our beloved Philippines continues to burn bright,” he said, using the Philippines’ term for the waters (legally) under their control. Rappler reports Marcos’ thundering support for the Philippines in the waters — and his gracious tribute to the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard and the fisherfolk on the frontline — netted him two long standing ovations from lawmakers. Interestingly, [Rappler compares the comments]( with Marcos’ two previous SONAs. At his first in 2022, he said he would “not preside over any process that will abandon even one square inch of territory of the Republic of the Philippines to any foreign power.” Last year, he vowed to “protect our sovereign rights and preserve our territorial integrity, in defense of a rules-based international order.” I hope I’m not reading too much into it, but he does appear to be far more confident in his position now. That the speech comes just days after a [fresh breakthrough in communications]( with China following months of on-water antagonisms and pledges of support from the US and Japan surely has helped shore up (hehe!) his footing. ## It’s the economy, bobo Inflation is starting to chill out — except for rice which is hovering around 20%! — and growth is back on track. But who cares about such things when you’re a worker struggling to make your bills! Dare I say it, I’m impressed Marcos has made that distinction. It does feel a bit uneasy to hear it from the man whose family name is synonymous with ostentatious pilfering of country funds, but this is a comment many world leaders seem to dodge making. “The hard lesson of this last year has made it very clear that whatever current data proudly bannering our country as among the best-performing in Asia means nothing to a Filipino, who is confronted by the price of rice at 45 to 65 pesos per kilo,” Marcos said, [as reported by Bloomberg]( Yes! It’s true! Getting rice prices down has been a priority for a while now, but Marcos is adding a review into energy prices and new infrastructure projects that will both bring new jobs and improve connectivity. Agriculture is a particular priority for the year ahead, he said. ## Sara Duterte, the ‘designated survivor’ Vice President Sara Duterte told media yesterday that not only was she not planning on attending, she would not watch it at all. “The Vice President will not watch the SONA on TV or gadgets,” her office said yesterday, [as per ABS-CBN]( Instead, she spent the day in Bohol province, where [Vice Governor Dionisio Victor A. Balite died]( last week. “I am bringing a message of hope to Boholanos that we can help each other for the sake of our town,” Duterte said. ## ‘Bloodless’ war on drugs to continue Marcos has benefited greatly from the residual shock of predecessor Rodrigo Duterte’s horrific war on drugs and his own policy rarely gets international attention. Marcos’ ‘bloodless’ war continues, and he made quick reference to it last night. The campaign will continue along the “eight Es of an effective anti-illegal drugs strategy,” none of which are “extermination,” he said. By the [President’s Communications Office’s reckoning]( the campaign has netted 97,000 arrests. This figure includes ‘more than 6000 high-value targets that included 440 government employees, 42 of which were from the uniformed personnel and 77 were elected officials.’ No, Carlos Conde, senior researcher of the Human Rights Watch said in a statement [as per the Philippine Centre for Investigative Journalism]( “President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. not only failed to declare an end to the ‘war on drugs’ or outline a human-rights based approach to illegal drugs — he made the spurious and baseless claim that the continuing anti-drug campaign has been bloodless.” ‘From June 30, 2023 to July 1 this year, 360 deaths in anti-illegal drug operations were recorded. A third or 34.3 percent of these had been blamed on agents of the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), or Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP),’ PCIJ reported. ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

Voters are angry at Nicolás Maduro’s government, and massively favor an opposition bid for change. But in a context of political repression and violence, the election is not free and fair, and nobody expects things to play out linearly. Possibilities to thwart the results include last minute disqualification of opposition candidate Edmundo González or massive fraud, though either option could trigger street unrest, reports AFP [  ]. Experts say a transition is difficult without an immunity agreement for Maduro. International support from the U.S. could create a legal off-ramp for Maduro and allies, “so that if the president loses, he will agree to give up power,” wrote Roberto Patiño in a New York Times [  ] op-ed last week. “It is an opportunity that won’t come around again anytime soon, and the window to seize it is rapidly closing.” “At this point Maduro has no good options,” Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Atlantic Council told the Financial Times [  ]. “His least bad may be to ban the opposition and move forward with a sham election but that will likely provoke an international backlash.” More Venezuela Analysts and opposition leaders say Venezuela’s electoral authorities have made organizational decisions aimed at confusing voters and creating obstacles to a free presidential organization, reports Reuters [  ]. (See last Friday’s briefs [  ].) Venezuela’s ballot features 38 political parties. “They make the election feel legitimate and democratic, even though the electoral process has already been considered far from fair,” reports the New York Times [  ]. The confusing ballot features pictures of incumbent Nicolás Maduro prominently and multiple times, one of the many ways the government is skewing Sunday’s election in its favor, according to analysts. In the absence of an independent electoral authority, thousands of opposition supporters are organizing grassroots efforts to mobilize and support voters in the election, reports the Associated Press [  ]. “The Unitary Platform coalition hopes the mere presence of large numbers of watchful voters outside polling places will neutralize some ruling party strategies that in the past left them without representatives inside the facilities, kept them away from vote counts and rendered them voiceless in the event of irregularities.” Maduro said Friday that Venezuela would face a “bloodbath” and “civil war” if he is not reelected. (Infobae [  ]) Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva urged Venezuela\\'s government to respect the result of the presidential election, saying he was \"scared\" by Maduro’s bloodbath remarks, reports Reuters [  ]. \"I have told Maduro that the only chance for Venezuela to return to normality is to have a widely respected electoral process,\" Lula said. There are serious doubts over whether Maduro would accept an electoral loss — “the Biden administration is particularly concerned that the Maduro government could claim victory without verifiable results,” reports the New York Times [  ]. Opposition leader María Corina Machado’s security chief was released from jail last week, a day after he was arrested on charges of gender violence. “Venezuela\\'s opposition has repeatedly denounced arrests and other moves by the authorities that they say are meant to harm its election campaign and prevent a fair election,” reports Reuters [  ]. It was just the latest in a series of logistical headaches faced by the opposition campaign, in the midst of government harassment that includes arresting local vendors who provide services such as food or sound equipment, reports the Washington Post [  ]. In Guyana’s Essequibo region, residents are warily watching Venezuela’s electoral process: while there haven’t been new developments regarding Venezuela’s claim of Guyana’s territory, analysts say that Maduro could fabricate a crisis in order to drum up support or in order to overturn a negative election result. (Guardian [  ]) In the midst of electoral uncertainty, Venezuela’s long catastrophic economy has experienced a measure of improvement — estimates peg this year’s growth rate at 4.2%, reports El País [  ]. Regional Relations Venezuela is “a model for digital authoritarianism and an exporter of democratic backsliding to the rest of the Americas,” according to a new report from the Atlantic Council [  ]. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Friday that his administration was putting together “a proposal to join” the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s flagship infrastructure and investment project. (South China Morning Post [  ]) Mexican president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum criticized U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump for his “rude” language after he gave a speech recounting his past negotiations with incoming economy minister Marcelo Ebrard. The comments mark a potentially tense relationship, reports Bloomberg [  ]. Current Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called Trump “a friend” and said he would write to the former U.S. president to warn him against pledging to close the border or blaming migrants for bringing drugs into the United States, reports the Associated Press [  ]. Mexico Sheinbaum’s cabinet picks have confirmed continuity with the outgoing López Obrador administration — this month she announced that current welfare and labour ministers, who manage more than $30 billion of annual spending for social programs central to the ruling Morena party’s popularity, will stay on, reports the Financial Times [  ]. Most Mexicans feel the country’s justice system is broken — but the reform championed by AMLO focuses on the wrong issue, how judges are chosen. The government’s “proposal will do nothing to address the true bottleneck in Mexico’s justice system: prosecutors’ willingness and capacity to investigate,” argues Human Rights Watch researcher Tyler Mattiace in Americas Quarterly [  ]. Guatemala “The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said on Friday that democracy in Guatemala \"remains in danger,\" despite election winner Bernardo Arevalo assuming the presidency this year after a post-electoral crisis.” — Reuters [  ] Migration Panama\\'s government expects to start deportation flights for migrants crossing the Darién gap within two to three months, according to the country’s new migration chief. (Reuters [  ]) At least 40 people died after a boat carrying about 80 Haitian migrants caught fire last week. (Reuters [  ], New York Times [  ]) The tragedy was apparently triggered by matches used in a Vodou ceremony, reports the Miami Herald [  ]. Haiti Haitian Prime Minister Gary Conille enjoys support among individual members of the presidential council that named him to the post, but his relation with them as a group has become increasingly strained since he took office in June: last week a dinner hosted by a member of the presidential council “erupted into a near fight between Conille and the head of one of the sectors represented on the council, Claude Joseph, a former foreign minister and former prime minister,” reports the Miami Herald [  ]. The U.S.’s ambassador to the U.N. arrived in Haiti today and will push the presidential council to advance towards elections in order to have an elected government by February 2026. “Though the presidential council has started the process of forming a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council, there has been conflict and criticism already over how the members will be chosen,” reports the Miami Herald [  ]. Colombia Colombian President Gustavo Petro inaugurated a new session of Congress on Saturday, and promised to propose legislation aimed at overhauling the health sector and to pursue labor reform, reports the Associated Press [  ]. The AQ podcast [  ] looks at Petro’s government so far, “trying to separate rhetoric from reality, understand areas where his government has been successful and identify challenges and risks in his remaining two years in office.” Argentina Argentine President Javier Milei’s market honeymoon is ending, according to the Financial Times [  ]. “Investors are concerned that controlling inflation at all costs is now distracting from the other ingredients for Argentina’s long-term recovery: the removal of currency controls, accumulation of reserves and access to international capital markets.” Milei’s sister and main advisor, Karina, apologized to France after Vice President Victoria Villarruel called the European country \"colonialist\" and its people \"hypocrites\" in an argument over alleged racist chants by Argentine footballers, reports the Buenos Aires Times [  ]. The episode comes as Milei gears up to travel to France for the 2024 Olympics. Last week ruling Libertad Avanza lawmakers visited individuals convicted and sentenced to jail time for crimes against humanity committed during Argentina\\'s brutal 1976-1983 military dictatorship — including Alfredo Astiz, convicted in the case of two French nuns who were killed after he infiltrated Madres de Plaza de Mayo. (El País [  ], Buenos Aires Times [  ], Perfil [  ]) Brazil The Brazilian government’s push for a National Care Policy has put women’s caregiving burden on the public agenda — Brazilian Report [  ]. Varî Vãti Marubo is well past 100 years old, and may be the oldest person still living deep in the Amazon rainforest, reports the New York Times [  ]. Peru A record 54 parties have filed paperwork to participate in Peru’s 2026 presidential elections. The sheer number “raises the risk that candidates with very little popular support may face off in a second-round election, fueling uncertainty,” reports Bloomberg [  ]. Among the candidates is former President Alberto Fujimori, though he is legally barred from running. Fujimori was convicted in 2009 of involvement in the killing of 25 Peruvians during his administration in 1992, has three convictions on corruption charges and owes about $15 million to the Treasury, reports AFP [  ]. Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, \"not only maintained constant communication\" with police and military commanders who killed dozens of protesters in 2022, but \"decided to promote officials who had played key roles during these operations,\" according to a new Amnesty International report.

The disturbing story of two 1904 marathon runners View in browser  Africa Edition | 22 July 2024 [ Who were the first Africans to compete at the Olympic Games? The answer is a complex and awful story about two marathon runners from South Africa who were part of a delegation to attend the 1904 St Louis World’s Fair, which was staged in tandem with the Olympics. Reminiscent of human zoos, the fair held athletic days for “savages”. South Africans Jan Mashiani and Len Tau competed at the fair and then went on to enter the Olympic marathon, where officials were unable to pronounce their names. Sports historian Francois Cleophas recounts [ this dastardly tale. Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces was created in 2013 by dictator Omar al-Bashir. A decade later, the paramilitary force is at the centre of a war that has caused widespread violence and a humanitarian crisis. The force used military, economic and political strategies to secure state power. Federico Manfredi Firmian outlines [ the group’s rise, which is illustrative of what can go wrong when armed groups infiltrate state institutions.

South Africa has a joblessness crisis: fixing it will take fresh thinking to find a game-changer [ Imraan Valodia, University of the Witwatersrand South Africa needs a game-changer that is going to shift the economy onto a more employment-intensive growth path. From our international editions Long COVID puzzle pieces are falling into place – the picture is unsettling [ Ziyad Al-Aly, Washington University in St. Louis A new study finds the risks of developing long COVID declined over the first two years of the pandemic.

Oh my days, no one does it like the Philippines. From 3pm Manila-time today, every news outlet in the country will be singularly focused on the annual event. President Bongbong Marcos has a hell of a lot to chat about this year from the post-pandemic economic recovery to the South China Sea. But for gossipy outsiders like myself, the real story is that Vice President Sara Duterte has declined to attend. That in itself is interesting, given how huge the address is. Then she had to go and say something bananas: She won’t be there because she’s the self-appointed ‘designated survivor.’ Such a thing does not exist in the Philippines and the response to the comment has ranged from eye-rolling to wondering if she’s making a bomb threat. [You all just didn’t get it]( she said. I was so impressed with Marcos Jr’s speech at the Shangri La Dialogue earlier this year I am, dare I say it, looking forward to this afternoon. If he can bring that energy and insight to domestic issues, I think it could be very valuable. Also will be keeping my eyes peeled for Heart Evangelista, who will certainly treat the event like it’s the Oscars. ## 🇹🇭 Srettha heads back to court Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thaivisin will be back in court Wednesday, [Reuters reports]( “The court calls for more information including evidence and from individuals that were previously summoned,” the Constitutional Court said in a statement. It doesn’t sound like it’ll be particularly juicy, but with his job on the line and the Court vowing an outcome by September who can say! Move Forward watchers will have to [wait until Aug. 7]( ## 🇮🇩 Transition reaches key ministry, but nepotism criticism lurks President Joko Widodo is on his way out and Prabowo Subianto is on the way in. Good news for Thomas Djiwandono, nephew and financial affairs adviser to Prabowo, who was last week sworn in as a deputy finance minister. The transition in this ministry is being widely watched, with many of Prabowo’s flagship policies very fiscally ambitious. “The addition of Thomas will make it much easier to communicate,” Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said at a joint press conference last week, [as reported by Reuters]( ## 🇲🇾 Mahathir is in hospital Mahathir Mohamad, former prime minister of Malaysia (twice) and freshly 99 years old, has been hospitalised for a bad cough, [Bloomberg reports]( He went to the National Heart Institute last Monday. There has not been much of an update since on how he is travelling — or even if he is still in — but given his age and bumpy health issues earlier in the year, it is definitely worth flagging. ## Interesting reads [TikTok e-commerce grows fourfold in ASEAN, narrows gap with Shopee]( (Nikkei Asia) _Since its e-commerce debut in 2021, TikTok has launched a hiring spree in Southeast Asia, where incumbent players have reduced headcounts in an effort to become profitable.

Amidst an assassination attempt against Donald Trump, drama over whether President Joe Biden will stay in the race, and a series of scandals at the Republican National Convention, Latin America went rather ignored in most English-language media. But fear not! PWS has you covered. Instead of our usual long-form feature article, we thought it might be fun to bring you all the important stories in in Latin America that the big media companies missed. The Trump/Bukele breakup And we can start with a falling out between two of the most dominant right-wing strongmen leaders in the Americas. Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, has in recent years become a rising star among the “law and order” right— not just in Latin America, and Donald Trump, ex-president and the current frontrunner in U.S. presidential elections in November. The self-proclaimed “coolest dictator in the world”, spoke at CPAC, in the U.S. in February, and received a hero’s welcome [  ]. After an authoritarian crackdown reduced crime in the country — as well as imprisoned over 2% of El Salvador’s population — Bukele won re-election in the country in a landslide despite second presidential terms being prohibited by Constitutional law [  ]. Trump and Bukele enjoyed a good relationship during Trump’s time as president. The Biden administration has continued largely turning a blind eye towards human rights violations, democratic backsliding, and abuses of power by Bukele in exchange for cooperation on migration issues [  ]. Bukele has often supported Trump even after he left the presidency and criticized legal proceedings [  ] against the former president in the U.S. as an erosion of democracy. Bukele’s supporters across the region are generally fans of Trump as well. But during a long and rambling acceptance speech at the RNC, Trump attacked his former ally, falsely claiming that El Salvador, among other countries in the region, is sending their criminals to the U.S. in an effort to get rid of them. There is no evidence this claim is true for any country in Latin America. [  ] The comments sparked confusion, backlash, and even denial among Bukele supporters in Latin America, with some speculating that Trump confused Bukele with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, but that seems belied by Trump’s speech itself. In addition to naming Bukele, he also referred to “a 70% drop in crime”, and “someone I got along great with in my first term”— neither descriptors that could be applied to Maduro. Bukele responded to the remarks only indirectly, tweeting “Taking the high ground”, and not addressing Trump’s comments or accusations. The episode illustrates a tension, however, between MAGA supporters in Latin America and their North American cousins. As much as elites in Latam may consider themselves “part of the club”, it is clear that U.S. Republicans do not return the sentiment. In related news, a report by Human Rights Watch [  ] this week identified over 3,000 minors who have been detained under Bukele’s “state of exception”, some of which have been subjected to treatment that amounts to torture [  ]. Panama As we have covered here at PWS before, Panama’s new President, José Raúl Mulino, has promised to close the Darien Gap [  ]. The government has already erected razor wire obstacles on some of the main migrant trails— though they are more an inconvenience than a real closure, easily walked around. As part of reporting for stories on the subject, PWS has spoken with immigrants who have recently crossed the Darien as well as experts on the border regions. The obstacles, as well as promised deportation flights funded by the U.S., are more symbolic than practical barriers. Only a very small percentage of arrivals into Panama are actually being deported. Nonetheless, the government claimed on Wednesday that the optics are having an effect. Numbers dropped in late July [  ] compared to previous months, though other factors may be more responsible than government actions, including seasonal cycles which tend to ebb in the winter and Summer. Racism at Copa America Argentina defeated Colombia 1-0 in the championship game of the Copa Americana last Sunday. But footage [  ] of aftergame celebrations posted by Enzo Fernández, who also plays for Chelsea, on his Instagram account appeared to show him and his teammates involved in chants that included racist and homophobic slurs about members of the France team. Fernández later apologized, saying the video did not “reflect my beliefs or my character”. The French Football Association immediately condemned the video [  ], and Fernández will face disciplinary action from the Chelsea football club. FIFA has also launched an investigation. The video has inspired public debate about racism in Argentina, conversations that have at times become heated. Argentine Vice President Victoria Villarruel, in response to conversations about systemic racism in the country, said [  ] that Argentina “never had second-class citizens” and “never imposed our way of life on anyone” two days before the centenary of the Argentine state massacring 500 Indigenous people. It is not the first time that Villarruel has engaged in historical denialism. She also regularly, and without evidence, claims that the number of dissidents killed during Argentina’s military dictatorship has been exaggerated by historians.

Uncontacted tribe in Peru emerges Rare photographs of an uncontacted indigenous community, the Mascho Piro [  ], the largest uncontacted tribe in the world, emerged this week in Peru. Roughly 50 Mashco Piro people have appeared in southeastern Peru, in recent days near forests being logged by commercial interests. In a separate incident, another group, of 17, appeared near the neighboring village of Puerto Nuevo, near another indigenous nation, the Yine community The Yine, who are not uncontacted, speak a language related to Mashco Piro, and have previously reported that the Mashco Piro angrily denounced the presence of loggers on their land. Several logging companies hold timber concessions inside the territory that belongs to the Mashco Piro people. The nearest is just a few miles from where the Mashco Piro was filmed. One company, Canales Tahuamanu, that operates inside the Mashco Piro territory has built more than 200 km of roads for its logging trucks to extract timber. It is certified by the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) for its supposedly sustainable and ethical operations there, despite the Peruvian government acknowledging eight years ago that it is cutting down trees within Mashco Piro territory. You can view all of the photos and videos here [  ]. Venezuela goes to the polls this Sunday Venezuela holds elections on Sunday, July 28. The government of Nicolas Maduro, which trails in most polling, has arrested leading opposition members in recent weeks. In public statements, Maduro has warned of a popular uprising if the right wing removes him from power. “If they do not want Venezuela to fall into a bloodbath, into a fratricidal civil war,” the ruling party must win the presidential elections on July 28, Maduro told a campaign event in Caracas on Tuesday [  ]. Maduro added that only a victory for his party could preserve peace in the country. The opposition meanwhile says that the removal of Maduro from power would allow the nearly 8 million people who have fled the country since 2015 to finally return home.

Spanish word of the Week Caribear - to Caribe (dominate) As Bukele and Trump fans tried to come to terms with the tension between their two favorite strongmen, public debate raged. We found ourselves reading a lot of comments from all sides of the conversation. As part of that, we kept running into the word Caribear. To be completely honest, we didn’t recognize the word! We had to look it up to understand what people meant when they were saying that Trump was Caribeando Bukele. Turns out, it’s Venezuelan slang for “to dominate” someone, “to exercise dominion over” someone, or, “to manipulate and control through cunning”. We think that’s pretty badass. English doesn’t really have a word for this, but we love that it seems to have evolved from “Caribe”, or the Caribbean. Watch out for those people from the Caribbean! Apparently, they will dominate you if you let them! Consider yourself warned, and steer a wide berth, piratas! Hasta pronto!

Venezuela “Organizational decisions by Venezuela's electoral authorities – from polling station staffing to the lay-out of the ballot - have been made with the intention of confusing voters and creating obstacles to a free presidential election on July 28, say opposition figures and analysts… Of the 15,797 polling stations nationwide, at least 8,000 will have just one ballot box, up from 6,800 locations in the 2018 presidential contest, according to official figures. With more votes being cast at each box, such locations are considered more difficult to monitor for possible fraud,” reports Reuters [  ]. Regional Relations “The United States can support the Venezuelan people in their fight for democracy by creating a legal off-ramp for Mr. Maduro and his allies so that if the president loses, he will agree to give up power. It is an opportunity that won’t come around again anytime soon, and the window to seize it is rapidly closing. Without it, the likely outcome of this month’s vote will be more repression, more forced migration and more suffering,” says Roberto Patiño at The New York Times [  ]. Catherine Osborn explains at Foreign Policy [  ] the outlook for regional relations between a potential Trump administration and Latin America, noting that Trump has “pledged 10 percent tariffs on all worldwide imports. If he makes good on that promise, it would deeply impact trade with the region.” Elsewhere in her Latin America Brief [  ], Osborn notes that a thaw in relations between Cuba and South Korea has led to tensions between Cuba and North Korea. FOIA requests reveal that the CIA has kept tabs on Brazil’s Lula for more than five decades, reports El País [  ], noting that “This surveillance resulted in a total of 819 documents totaling 3,300 pages.” Americas Quarterly [  ] recalls plans in 1940 for Mexico to establish “a broad national program that foresaw the creation of a state monopoly to supply morphine, at nominal prices and as prescribed by doctors, to Mexicans suffering from drug addiction. The objective was to alleviate addicts’ demand for morphine.” US pressure, however, stymied the initiative. Brazil Lula is looking to establish a global alliance to combat food insecurity. (MercoPress [  ]) “Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has authorized a review to reduce social welfare benefits to meet the 2025 fiscal target,” reports Reuters [  ]. At the same time, “Brazil is preparing to hold the most expensive local elections in its history as political parties and congressional leaders cleave off growing chunks of the public budget,” reports FT [  ], noting, “Politicians have handed themselves BR$4.9bn ($900mn) in public funds to pay for campaign activities ahead of municipal elections in October… equal to the total spent on presidential, gubernatorial and state assembly elections combined in 2022.” Mexico A Caterpillar factory in Mexico has received complaints of labor rights abuses and potential breaches of the USMCA trade agreement, but the Biden administration has declined to pursue the issue, reports The New York Times [  ]. (via Latin America Risk Report [  ]) “One of Mexico’s most powerful crime groups, the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG), is employing forced disappearance and exploiting corruption to build up a burgeoning local drug market on its home turf of Guadalajara,” explains InSight Crime [  ]. Regional “The Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF) has allocated $2.74 billion in loans across nine countries in the region to help fuel their energy transition, shore up their ecosystems and improve infrastructure,” reports Reuters [  ], highlighting funding expansion in the Caribbean. “Caribbean leaders struggling to raise hundreds of millions after Hurricane Beryl wiped out entire islands have asked the UK government to back a “Marshall plan” to rebuild their devastated countries.” (The Guardian [  ]) Cuba Reuters [  ] highlights the increasing use of electric bikes in scooters in Cuba, which have helped respond to scarce and expensive oil and less frequent public transportation. Haiti France24 [  ] highlights the “iron grip” of gangs in Haiti and the “connivance between state authorities and gangs, and groups wishing to use gangs to win elections and occupy the sphere of power.” Unsubscribe\", 'links': ['https://latinamericadailybriefing.substack.com/p/latin-america-daily-briefing-71924', 'https://substack.com/redirect/df43c45a-233f-47e0-bd3a-a23be3b1964b?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/532473a0-0f02-442f-9d38-445114bd8407?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/a4561dea-6d75-4a78-ae18-47d5cd8a9d7f?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/29f81195-e10a-4159-8c6d-377ea5333dd5?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/29f81195-e10a-4159-8c6d-377ea5333dd5?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/ff6ba562-1ace-4eba-abee-624f4ec8dc64?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/66ae8a75-4387-4e75-a3fb-2c668091f4f0?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/979968f4-9b19-4fa0-a86c-dd24114307a3?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/1957d9b8-bcb7-4039-956f-10cdededa69e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/d0a7c585-eb02-47b2-b2d0-2f53f1fd6ff0?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/28362d97-8d02-4c7c-973a-651dc8170631?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/949ef4e9-53d9-472b-a7b0-276562b35911?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/a45180c3-fe48-4f2f-9681-4a9215e1cc60?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/1e7775d7-ecf7-4098-99e1-a0b42a0c4e8c?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/dc6fcfb3-113f-4340-bfcd-2e0e6983f0b8?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/6387d17c-856d-4e69-b20a-b6184f18026c?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.com/redirect/1e783c30-c165-4647-bbde-cf0bac33abc4?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4', 'https://substack.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.PG_8s0jZsPk7RcxwXY0T5N0t__Zz4bGEcx5-UEBXaaQ?']}, {'text': 'Manage your newsletters with your account Today Crowdstrike admits \\'defect\\' in software update caused IT outage that is wreaking worldwide chaos Cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike has admitted that a \"defect\" in a software update has caused the IT outage currently wrecking havoc worldwide.

From hand and wrist injuries because of the excessive use of a mouse to spinal changes from prolonged sitting. A recent study shows these problems aren’t new. The skeletal remains of scribes from ancient Egypt show that our ancestors battled occupational health hazards like osteoarthritis in the jaw, spine, shoulder, thumb and knees. Petra Brukner Havelková and Veronika Dulíková share [ the details of their findings. There appears to be no end in sight for the deadly conflict that has racked the Democratic Republic of Congo for 30 years. Instead, the humanitarian crisis is worsening. A new United Nations report provides a gloomy account of the enormous scale of violence against civilians and dim prospects for peace. Anthoni van Nieuwkerk unpacks [ the report and shares his insights on resolving the dire situation in eastern DRC. The Kenyan president recently fired his cabinet and promised a new, broadbased government in response to a mounting political challenge from the country’s young population. Some have called for a more radical approach to resolving the crisis: dissolving parliament and calling a new election. John Mukum Mbaku sets out [ the daunting task facing the embattled president. Natasha Joseph Commissioning Editor Is your desk job killing your back? Ancient Egyptian scribes had the same aches and pains, say researchers [ Petra Brukner Havelková, National Museum (Národní muzeum) Prague; Veronika Dulíková, Charles University The physical damage caused by their unusual working positions can be seen on the scribes’ skeletons.

Her car was vandalized and the brake hose was cut as she campaigned in the city of Barquisimeto, in the northwestern state of Lara. (La Silla Vacía [  ], AlbertoNews [  ]) This follows the arrest of Machado’s security chief yesterday, as many warn of increasing repression in the lead up to the July 28th election between Edmundo González—selected as Machado’s replacement after she was deemed disqualified by the Maduro government—and president Nicolás Maduro. Machado’s security chief, Milciades Ávila, was arrested on “trumped up charges” following tensions and traded insults between Maduro supporters and the Machado campaign last weekend. “At least eight people connected to the opposition campaign have been detained in recent days in four states across the country, including the owner of a sound truck Machado and González hired during a recent rally in the central city of Valencia,” notes AP [  ], while Reuters [  ] adds that “Foro Penal, a non-governmental organization, said on Monday that 102 people have been detained since the start of the election campaign on July 4.” (AP [  ], Reuters [  ], BBC [  ], El País [  ]) More Venezuela If Maduro wins the election against González, “as many as one-third of Venezuelans would consider migrating,” reports The New York Times [  ].

Haiti Haiti’s diaspora has a role to play in helping stabilize the country, explain Esnold Jure and Georges Fauriol at USIP [  ], arguing that the diaspora can provide more than just remittances: “Through direct investment and by enabling greater capital flows into key economic sectors, the diaspora can play an active role in Haiti’s economic reconstruction while ensuring a more relevant participation in the country’s future.” Mexico President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum plans to continue AMLO’s tradition of “Mañanera” daily press briefings.

Goldman Donald Trump’s July 17 Bloomberg interview prompted headlines to the effect that “the US would not defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion under his presidency.” He said no such thing: He said that China doesn’t need to invade Taiwan, which lies within range of as much Chinese ordnance as the mainland cares to shoot at it. He said he can’t defend it.  ** Two-thirds of Dems want Biden out of the race now ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Emma Shortis A recent poll reveals that two-thirds of Democratic voters prefer President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, with concerns over his age and electability driving this sentiment. Biden and his team need to realize there is no way for him to allay these concerns over his decline – simply because he cannot get younger. He cannot prove he is not too old because he is too old.  ** ------------------------------------------------------------ ** Yellen’s de-dollarization fears will only get worse ------------------------------------------------------------ Subscribe to AT+ Premium ( to read the latest from William Pesek, who writes that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's fears of de-dollarization are escalating. Amid rising global skepticism of the US dollar, Yellen's concerns reflect growing challenges to its status as the dominant reserve currency, potentially altering global financial dynamics.  ** Chinese underworld takeover of US illicit pot trade ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Sebastian Rotella, Kirsten Berg, Garrett Yalch and Clifton Adcock Chinese mafias — some with suspected ties to the Chinese government — have taken advantage of state-level legalization to dominate a nationwide black market for marijuana. These syndicates are utilizing sophisticated networks and exploiting legal loopholes to expand their operations, leading to heightened concerns among law enforcement.  ** Biden has Covid – Here’s what an over-80 can expect ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Hassan Vally President Biden, now diagnosed with Covid-19, faces unique health risks due to his age. For those over 80, Covid-19 can lead to severe complications. Biden, who has been diagnosed with Covid twice before, has received his Covid vaccine and booster shots, and has taken the first dose of the antiviral drug Paxlovid. No doubt, Biden will be receiving the best of medical care.  ** Trump sending shockwaves across global chip industry ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Nigel Green In response to Trump’s recent market-rattling suggestion that Taiwan should pay the US for defense and assertion that it captured “about 100%” of America’s semiconductor business, it’s crucial for Taiwan to bolster its defense collaborations with the US and other allies. A strong defense partnership not only ensures Taiwan’s security but also reinforces investor confidence.  ** Trump’s JD Vance problem is now China’s, too ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By William Pesek Trump’s choice of JD Vance as his running mate could signal an even bigger upstaging of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s grandest economic plans going forward. It’s anyone’s guess what having China-hawk Vance – who’s all-in on revoking Beijing’s “most-favored nation” status – whispering in the president’s ear might mean for a Trump 2.0 presidency.   ** China EVs still driving for EU’s protected markets ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Jeff Pao Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are determined to penetrate the European Union's protected markets despite facing regulatory barriers and tariffs. As the EU’s new tariffs are significantly lower than the 100% tariff imposed by the US in May, Chinese EV firms can still survive in the EU, either by absorbing the new tariffs or opening new plants in the region.  ** Trump shooting conspiracy theories flying left and right ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Katherine M. Fitzgerald In the wake of a recent incident involving Donald Trump, conspiracy theories are proliferating from all sides. These theories range from claims of a coordinated attack to suggestions of a staged event.

It may appear justified because of the internal conflicts in both countries. Nan Tian argues [ however, that high military spending has negative implications. It diverts resources from essential public services and increases the political power of the military – with far-reaching consequences. When Senegal’s El Hadji Amadou Dia Bâ won a silver medal in the 400m hurdles at the 1988 Olympic Games, the historic achievement wasn’t just about his talent or commitment. It was also a testament to his country’s drive to develop its athletes to international levels. Senegal is yet to win another medal at the games, which Nalla Socé Fall explains [ is a clear sign that the country needs to rethink its current sports policies. Julius Maina Regional Editor East Africa Military spending in DRC and South Sudan rose fastest in the world: society ends up paying the price [ Nan Tian, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute High military spending can sap resources meant for education, healthcare and infrastructure.

The Conference involves all nine rulers across the country and will touch on topics of enormous significance, including a citizenship ruling that could leave thousands stateless as well as the appointment of a new judge, Teoh writes. This is, of course, still underway, but I cannot get enough of a rulers analysis and this is a great one. Flash your mind back to March this year when Malaysia erupted in outrage (and counter-outrage) over socks snapped at an outlet of convenience chain KK Mart. The socks, embroidered with ‘Allah,’ have been the focus of religious charges offences laid against both the chain and its supplier, Xin Jian Chang. Both were ordered to pay RM60,000 in fines this week at a Shah Alam court, [Malaysiakini reported]( “This case has attracted a lot of attention because it involves a religious issue… In future, (everyone should) be more sensitive about issues that involve the sensitivity of the Muslim community or any religion,” Shah Alam Sessions Court judge Muhamad Anas Mahadzir said, [as per Straits Times]( As expected, former prime minister Najib Razak has filed an appeal against a ruling barring him from serving his remaining six years under house arrest not jail. It’ll be heard Oct. 7, [Malaysiakini reports]( ## 🇮🇩 NU confronts rare scandal Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s largest Islamic organisation (which also makes it the world’s largest, I believe), has really gotten itself into a knot this week. [A meeting earlier in the month]( between some members of NU’s youth wing and Israeli President Issac Herzog in Tel Aviv has forced the organisation onto the defensive, apologising to the public and promising that this meeting does not represent a change of heart. Indonesia does not have formal relations with Israel and, while the government hasn’t been particularly fierce, there has been widespread support for Palestine in the community over generations. “We understand that this is something that crossed the line in the context of the current situation [between Israel and Palestine],” NU chairman Yahya Cholil Staquf said on Tuesday, [as per the Jakarta Post]( The meeting was not approved or sanctioned by the executive board, and the five NU activists involved will face sanctions from the NU Jakarta branch. “Perhaps this Israeli lobbyist believed that these kids could help them share Israel’s message [in Indonesia], but in reality, what can they do now with the backlash that followed?” he added. Incoming vice president, Gibran Rakabuming Raka has officially resigned from his post as mayor of Solo in anticipation of inauguration in October. “I have plenty of tasks to do before the inauguration day,” he told reporters on the way out the door, [as per Jakarta Globe]( He knocked back chatter that he was stepping down earlier than necessary to free him up to campaign for other candidates in the regional elections. Like his brother, perhaps? It’s something [Tenggara Strategics mulled over for the Jakarta Post]( Gibran has been spotted out and about across Java, though he says it’s sharing policies of the incoming Prabowo Subianto. What has this analysis writer’s eyebrow raised though is that while it’s high-profile, it’s in stark contrast to who is actually involved in the transition. The eldest son of the incumbent president is reportedly sitting far away from the action. This line is key: ‘It’s safe to say that Gibran is struggling to prove he is on an equal footing with Prabowo in discussing matters related to the incoming government, regardless of his outward image as the embodiment of Jokowi’s influence in the next administration.’ Maybe it’s by design? Hmm, I don’t think so, but I’m also willing to entertain both that I am not privy to Istana intrigue and that we’re not on firm ground here and probably won’t be for some months yet. Further afield, the new capital of Nusantara is still experiencing major hiccups. The city is set to host its first-ever Independence Day celebrations on Aug. 17, but construction is lagging, [the Jakarta Post reports]( Poor weather has forced delays in securing water supply to the city and the development of solar power has only hit 10MW of a planned 50MW. The administration hopes new regulations allowing 95-year lease terms will help investor confidence, [according to Bloomberg]( ‘Pioneer businesses could be exempt from local city tariffs and may be allowed to pay for properties in instalments,’ the outlet reports of a government announcement last week. Land disputes are a major issue in the area with a Supreme Audit Agency report finding over 2,000 hectares of land surrounding the city is owned by parties other than the government. Former agriculture minister Syahrul Yasin Limpo goes down. He’s been sentenced to 10 years in prison for ‘corruption-related extortion, abuse of power and bribery involving ministry contracts with private vendors,’ [the Associated Press reports]( “The defendant has legally and convincingly been proven guilty of corruption. He wasn’t a good example as a public official, what he has done is counter the government’s efforts to fight corruption and enriched himself by corruption,” presiding Judge Rianto Adam Pontoh said. Officials from the ministry testified that ‘secretariats, directorates general and agencies within the ministry was required to give up 20% of their budgets to Limpo, as though they were indebted to him, and he threatened their jobs if they rejected his demands.’ AP notes he’s the sixth minister from Jokowi’s various cabinets to go down for corruption. ## 🇸🇬 ISA notices about support of terrorism, not Palestine, government says Singaporean authorities have slapped two people with Internal Security Act restriction notices, [Straits Times reports this week]( A 14-year-old unidentified male student and An’nadya An’nahari, a 33-year-old female former public servant, are alleged to have ‘self-radicalised’ since Oct. 7 last year. Neither can leave the country, move or change jobs without prior approval of the Internal Security Department. They also cannot use the internet. The government has stressed the interventions are not because the pair support Palestine, but because they hold beliefs that advocate for harm against non-Muslims and Israel. “Many of us sympathise with the Palestinian cause. I sympathise with the Palestinian cause. They should have their own country and not suffer like this. But sympathy for any foreign cause cannot mean we can support or allow terrorism. Action was taken against a young boy and An’nadya, not because they supported Palestine... Action was taken against the two of them because of their support for armed violence. And in the case of the young boy, because also that he was prepared to engage in armed violence himself,” Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam [told media on Monday]( He also flagged an increase in radicalisation among young people, noting that the teenager is among the youngest to receive an ISA order. Singapore doesn’t care that the US Department of Justice is cooling it on 1MDB architect and runaway, Jho Low. Local police say an Interpol Red Notice chasing his location and a provisional arrest is very much still in effect, [Bloomberg reports]( The outlet reminds that the city-state charged him in absentia all the way back in 2016. One day! An Interpol Red Notice seeking the location and provisional arrest of the financier, better known as Jho Low, remains in effect, the police said. Singapore charged Low in absentia and issued a warrant of arrest in 2016. Oof, those key exports keep falling. June data shows non-oil domestic exports dropped a big 8.7 percent on a year earlier, which is wild since it fell only 0.7 percent in May. [The Straits Times reports]( an earlier Bloomberg survey of economists expected a 1.3 percent decline. Yeesh! Antitrust klaxon! Grab’s move to buy up the island’s third-biggest taxi company will “significantly reduce” competition in Singapore, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore said last week. Grab and Trans-cab have until the end of this week to reassure CCCS that it will do nothing of the sort or else the merger won’t go ahead, [Nikkei Asia reports]( “This ruling does not change our determination to do everything that we can to offer affordable, reliable transport options to passengers in Singapore,” Yee Wee Tang, Grab Singapore's managing director, said in a statement as per the outlet.

Villavicencio, a former journalist, had run for president last year on an anti-corruption platform until he was gunned down by men on motorcycles. Police killed one of the gunmen at the scene, and in the weeks that followed, several of the suspects that had been detained were killed in prison before many answers were found (see LADB 10/9/23 [  ]) Among those found guilty last week are alleged Lobos faction leader Carlos Edwin Angulo, deemed guilty of planning the murder from prison, and Laura Dayanara Castillo, deemed the funder and coordinator. InSight Crime [  ], however, says “there is still no clarity as to who ordered the killing and why,” with Angulo claiming to be a scapegoat used to help officially close the case. Some have expressed concern that state actors may have been the true forces behind the murder given Villavicencio’s focus on countering corruption.

This session will see a new set of power dynamics at play as the government of national unity tries to find a foothold now that the African National Congress no longer holds a majority of parliamentary seats. For Hugh Corder the new arrangement offers [ an opportunity for MPs to hold members of the executive to account. This has not been a strong point of any of the parliaments this century. This resulted in periods in which the executive ran amok, to the detriment of the country. But he’s cautious: the representatives of the new parties might not behave as well as might be expected. For his part, Francois Venter argues [ that parliamentarians need first and foremost to acquaint themselves with the country’s 1996 constitution because it’s the country’s greatest asset under the current socioeconomic and political conditions. Then come questions about policy. What policies should emerge from a cabinet that’s made up of ministers from different parties? On education, Thandi Lewin urges [ the new minister to focus primarily on three things, including rebuilding the higher education system. When it comes to the environment, Patrick Bond suggests [ that the new minister needs to put people ahead of profit in the country’s efforts to achieve a just transition from a carbon-intensive economy. Citizens willingly pay taxes in return for public services such as education and health. That there have been protests against the rising number of taxes in Kenya for two successive years suggests that the unwritten fiscal social contract between the government and the people has broken down. Eric Magale and Mario Schmidt explore [ ways in which the country can begin to reset these relations.

South Africa’s new unity government must draw on the country’s greatest asset: its constitution [ Francois Venter, North-West University A sea change in the system of governance is needed to fix South Africa and rebuild an economy plagued by serious crises. Higher education faces many challenges in South Africa: 3 priorities for the new minister [ Thandi Lewin, University of Johannesburg In her new position, Nobuhle Nkabane inherits a portfolio rife with challenges. South Africa’s new environment minister must focus on people, not profits from fossil fuels – climate ecologist [ Patrick Bond, University of Johannesburg South Africa’s new environment minister has a strong business background, but the country needs a renewable energy champion who’ll also protect communities from fossil fuel corporates. Kenya protests show citizens don’t trust government with their tax money: can Ruto make a meaningful new deal? [ Eric Magale, University of Pretoria; Mario Schmidt, Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology Citizens willingly pay taxes in return for government using these resources to provide services such as education and health. Corruption hurts businesses but digital tools offer the hope of fighting it, say manufacturers in Ghana and Nigeria [ Samuel Adomako, University of Birmingham; Joseph Amankwah-Amoah, Durham University; Shlomo Tarba, University of Birmingham; Zaheer Khan, University of Aberdeen By promoting digitisation, governments can help create a more transparent and efficient business environment.

Over 80,000 people—representing over 1% of the population—have been arrested, including over 3,000 children, and allegations and convictions have been conducted without due process, often including “overly broad charges.” Based on field work and interviews with over 90 people in El Salvador, HRW documents cases of abuses, pressure, and violence against minors. In one case they describe [  ], “Police and soldiers arrested a 17-year-old student from a rural town in Sonsonate state on July 1, 2022, without showing her a warrant. On January 9, 2023, a judge pressured her and seven other children to jointly plead guilty to collaborating with the MS-13 gang in exchange for reduced sentences. Fearing longer sentences, they pleaded guilty and were sentenced to a year in prison. “We didn’t have an option,” she said. “We all wanted to see our mothers.”” “Despite the well-documented human rights abuses committed during the crackdown, improvements in security have helped make Bukele one of the region’s most popular presidents,” notes The Guardian [  ], highlighting his skirting of constitutional limits to run for a second term. Regional Relations A new Americas Quarterly special report [  ] explores the relationship between the US and Latin America ahead of the US presidential election on November 5th. Articles include a timeline [  ] of US-Latin America relations under Trump and Biden, a call [  ] for greater attention to the region, opinions [  ] of Latin American politicians and former high-ranking officials, and analysis of what the candidates may do if elected: “A second Biden term would continue to promote democracy while addressing hotspots like Haiti and Venezuela,” write [  ] Ricardo Zúniga and Nicholas Zimmerman. “A second Trump term would focus on reviving hemispheric economic growth through nearshoring and other policies,” writes [  ] Mauricio Claver-Carone. Brazil A now unsealed recording reveals former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro “discussing sensitive intelligence to help his eldest son, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, avoid criminal prosecution.” (The Brazilian Report [  ]) “Brazilian authorities launched a mega-operation in Rio de Janeiro that sent a force of nearly 2,000 military and civil officers into 10 low income neighborhoods Monday seeking to regain control of areas dominated by organized crime… The operation, which also seeks to carry out arrest warrants, has no end date,” reports AP [  ]. Venezuela “Over 70 people linked to Venezuelan opposition arrested in 10 days of election campaigning” (El País [  ]) Indigenous Communities Amid a lack of government action, Indigenous communities in Honduras are “rising up against the criminal forces behind an unprecedented wave of deforestation and colonisation in their territory,” reports The Guardian [  ]. “What was meant to be an occasion for celebration for the Tupinambá de Olivença Indigenous people – the long-awaited reunion with a sacred cloak taken from Brazil more than three centuries ago – has turned into a moment of frustration… Tupinambá de Olivença leaders have complained they were prevented from performing the necessary rituals to receive the relic, which is considered sacred,” notes The Guardian [  ], adding that several more cloaks remain “scattered across European museums” with no indication if they will return, too. Guatemala “Taiwan hopes to “deepen” cooperation and strengthen its “friendship” with Guatemala” after a visit from Guatemalan Congress President Nery Ramos,” reports Prensa Libre [  ]. Caribbean “Another 200 Kenyan police officers have left for Haiti under a UN-backed mission to try to quell rampant gang violence in the troubled Caribbean nation,” says France24 [  ]. Thousands remain displaced from Hurricane Beryl in the Caribbean, I explain at my Americas Migration Brief [  ] newsletter. Migration “A landmark ruling from Colombia’s Constitutional Court, T-232, is the first decision by the Court to rule on, and protect, the rights of a child born through surrogacy to prevent risk of statelessness, per a press release.” (via Americas Migration Brief [  ]) “Cuba's population fell by 18% between 2022 and 2023, mainly due to migration… according to an independent demographic study ready for publication to which EFE has had access.” (via Americas Migration Brief [  ]) Bolivia Bolivia has discovered a “mega field” of natural gas, reports AP [  ], noting that the Andean country’s natural gas production has slowed in recent years. Uruguay The center-left Broad Front coalition has the momentum in Uruguay’s upcoming presidential elections, says WPR [  ]. Football “The French Football Federation (FFF) plans to complain to FIFA about racist chants from members of Argentina's Copa America winning team,” reports AFP [  ], explaining that some players were celebrating on a live video and singing “a chant that dates back to the 2022 World Cup final that Argentina won against France that targets France's star striker Kylian Mbappe and includes homophobic insults.” Critter Corner “The chinampas of Mexico’s Xochimilco neighborhood host the endemic axolotl, an endangered freshwater salamander. In recent decades, its population and habitat have decreased dramatically as a result of urbanization, poor water quality and new predator fish species being introduced in the canals. Scientists are working with local farmers to preserve and study the axolotl population for its potential contribution to medical research,” explains Mongabay [  ].

Those policies also appealed to those for whom economic nationalism offered ideological comforts. But instead of safeguarding employment, these trade barriers often lead to higher consumer prices and retaliatory measures from other countries. ** Philippines wants to point more BrahMos missiles at China ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Gabriel Honrada The Philippines is looking to deploy additional BrahMos missiles aimed at deterring Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. This move is part of a broader strategy to bolster its defense capabilities and assert its territorial claims.

( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Charlie Hunt The advanced age of many US politicians raises questions about the implications for governance and policy-making.

Yet, there isn’t an international treaty specifically outlawing them. Penelope Andrews reflects [ on what the UN is doing to expand the definition of crimes against humanity – and why adding a gender lens is important. Chinstrap penguins are highly specialised predators, hunting for marine crustaceans called Antarctic krill. It’s useful to know how much of this food they catch to predict population trends and inform ecosystem management strategies, but it’s hard to observe the birds’ ocean hunting forays.

We’re joined this week but a whole lot of new readers so I thought I’d let this Mekong update out from under the paywall to celebrate/let everyone get familiar with what our premium subscriptions look like. See you Thursday for our maritime update. Upgrade now and support Dari Mulut ke Mulut ( Erin Cook ——————————————————————————— ## 🇹🇭 Digital wallets are a go! I might wait for Aug. 1 before I start celebrating Punters can finally start enrolling in the controversial digital wallet program from next month, Bloomberg reports. The Aug. 1 open date comes after Prime Minister Srettha Thaivisin and a panel convened to hatch out the finer details of this tricky plan. “The digital wallet program is a massive state program to inject money into the pockets of people, entrepreneurs and the overall economy. To ensure caution, whether legally or technically, especially regarding security, it has taken a long time. But the people won’t be waiting in vain,” Srettha promised, [as per Bloomberg]( Manufacturing is facing a nightmare with long-established factories — such as a Suzuki plant that churned out up to 60,000 cars a year — closing down as cheaper Chinese imports take over. “The Chinese are now trying to export left, right and centre. Those cheap imports are really causing trouble,” Supavud Saicheua, chairman of the state planning agency National Economic and Social Development Council, [told Reuters]( He added that Thai manufacturing is fundamentally broken and it is time for reform. For workers, it’s left many shocked, broke and with few options: “I don\\'t have any savings. I have hundreds of thousands of baht of debt. I\\'m old, where will I go to work? Who will hire me?” said Chanpen Suetrong, who has worked at the recently closed VMC Safety Glass factory in central Samut Prakan province. Please do not send Y Quynh Bdap back to Vietnam. That’s the message from Thai human rights groups after the co-founder of the Montagnards Stand for Justice group was picked up by police a day after meeting with officials from the Canadian embassy. He has refugee status in Thailand. Vietnam alleges he was involved in last year’s anti-government riots in Dak Lak, a claim he denies. “I am a human rights activist fighting for religious freedom and advocating for people’s rights. My activities are peaceful, consisting only of collecting and writing reports on human rights violations in Vietnam,” he [said in a video provided to the Associated Press]( by Thai pro-human rights lawmakers. A court on Monday delayed Bdap’s extradition hearing after it agreed with the defendant’s complaint that there simply had not been enough time to get everything together. “We did not have time to prepare the fight for the case today, which was politically motivated,” lawyer Nadthasiri Bergman told media outside the court, [as per Benar]( Hearings will be closed to the public citing national security concerns. ## 🇱🇦 Discontent in the economy, but few options I love nothing more than when the brains at Nikkei Asia turn their attention to the Lao economy. A big, [beautiful one here from Nikkei]( this week that looks at movements in the central bank and what they tell us about the state of the economy. Governor Bounleua Sinxayvoravong has walked out after two years — a period that has seen truly staggering inflation numbers, shortages in essentials and a general malaise in employment — but it’s unclear if he’s been forced out, or taking a different role focusing on these structural issues. The reshuffle comes as Laos faces a tough question, is it time to call in the IMF? Vientiane desperately needs cash to service its foreign debts, but foreign exchange reserves are circling the drain. “Laos doesn\\'t want to default on its foreign debts. But it also does not want to go to the IMF for a bailout out because of the political consequences,” one foreign banker who works with Lao clients told the outlet. China and Laos are almost done with a two-week joint military exercise on the outskirts of Vientiane, [Radio Free Asia reports]( A reported 300 Chinese personnel have joined 900 of their Lao counterparts in the exercises. “The Chinese side might have weapons and experiences that can be shared with us. The drill will help strengthen our military ties, organise and modernise our armed forces,” Lt. Col. Santi Chanthalangsone, who leads training for Lao personnel, told the outlet prior to the July 5 launch. We don’t want their hydropower electricity — that’s the message from residents in northern Thailand to their government which is planning to buy electricity generated from Laos’ Pak Beng Hydropower Dam. A petition to the Thai government includes signatures from eight Mekong provinces in Thailand, all of which fear territorial losses and water security issues. This has been a long-running issue along the border — court cases targeting Thai agencies for a perceived lack of action on their behalf have been running since at least 2017. \"[We can\\'t] call the project a clean energy [project] because it is bound to come at the expense of livelihoods, economic well-being and the culture of people living along the Mekong River,” the petition said, [as per the Bangkok Post]( ## 🇰🇭 Mother Nature activists jailed, Cambodian government flounders response The Cambodian military lost a helicopter in bad weather in the southwest, the Defence Ministry said over the weekend. There hasn’t been much update here and the facts are cagey — the Ministry is keeping mum but Air Force sources [told the AFP]( that a Chinese-made Z-9 helicopter with at least two people on board was missing. Another beautiful [interactive from the New York Times this week]( where the team has turned its attention to the Ream Military Base in Cambodia. These NYT interactives don’t often have much in the way of new info, but they are fun to read. This one is extra good in that it compares features of the base to similar Chinese-built and backed bases around the world and focuses primarily on expansion and physical construction. The fall-out over the Mother Nature arrests continues. Ten environmental activists linked to the NGO were jailed at the start of the month following July 2021 arrests for ‘plotting against the government’ while campaigning to keep the country’s waterways clean and safe, [BBC reports]( Three activists, Sun Ratha, Yim Leanghy and Spanish national founder Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, were sentenced to eight years, while the remaining seven were given six-year terms. Gonzalez-Davison and four others were convicted in absentia, while another was not present for sentencing. Only four attended sentencing, [DW reports]( “No one benefits from [it], let alone the government. As we have seen with previous cases like this, this tends to send people into shock for a while, but ultimately backfires because it inspires many others to take [the jailed activists\\'] place,” Gonzalez-Davidson told the BBC. Cambodia’s Permanent Mission to the UN has rejected comments from UN Human Rights spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan, who called the events “highly prejudicial” against the judiciary and called on the government to reassess the case, [CamboJA reports]( Whatever, says the Permanent Mission. “The environmental activists were charged not because they were exercising their rights and freedom, but for plotting against the government and insulting the King,” it said in a statement. The Mother Nature 10 are set to make appeals, with supporters noting that those that have been jailed have been split up among various provinces making it difficult for family and friends to rally behind them. ## 🇻🇳 Deals! Deals! Deals! (I feel like there are a few neighbours who would be jealous of a list like this) Vietnam is always a lot of business news, but it’s extra this week so let’s crank them out. Indian behemoth Adani is eyeing a port development in the country after securing “in-principle approval from the Vietnamese government,” [Bloomberg reports]( It’s still in the early stage of planning and there is little known about what functions the port would have, exactly, but similar projects in India, Sri Lanka and Tanzania have recently been launched. “The idea is to make India a maritime hub. We are targeting countries that are high on manufacturing or high on population, which will lead to high consumption. We are focusing on export volumes in these countries,” Karan Adani, managing director of Adani Ports and eldest son of founder Gautam, said, as per Bloomberg. Japanese lenders are gassing up Vietnam’s energy sector after the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and private investors pledged US$832 million, [Nikkei Asia reports]( The financing will go towards the development of gas pipes for Block B gas fields off the southern coast. The expected total cost of the project is around $10 billion. Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast is delaying the opening of its huge $4 billion plant in the United States ‘amid global uncertainties in the EV market,’ [Reuters reports]( It has revised its 100,000 EV production target this year down to 80,000 despite a bump in Q2 sales: “While the second-quarter delivery results were encouraging, ongoing economic headwinds and uncertainties in different macro-economies and (the) global EV landscape necessitate a more prudent outlook for the rest of the year,” the company said in a statement. Elsewhere, at least 11 people have been confirmed dead in a terrible landslide in the northern province of Ha Giang, [China Daily reports]( citing Vietnamese news sources. And African Swine Fever is back, with authorities concerned this outbreak could rival the deeply destabilising outbreaks in 2018 and 2019. “The risk of wider spread of the disease is very high, and it can affect food supplies, consumer prices and the environment,” local authorities said in a statement last week. ——— You are reading a plain text version of this post.

Leaders across Latin America were quick to condemn the violence; both Brazil’s Current President Lula da Silva and former president Bolsonaro expressed their support for Trump, with the former calling [  ] for all defenders of democracy to “vehemently repudiate” the attack, while Bolsonaro drew comparisons [  ] to his own stabbing in 2018 during a campaign event. Mexico’s AMLO called [  ] the attack “irrational and inhumane,” and the Secretary General of the Organization of American States Luis Almagro wrote on X [  ] that the organization condemns the attack “in the strongest terms.” Argentina’s Milei went so far as to blame the “international left” for the attack, arguing on X [  ] that the left “is ready to destabilize democracies and promote violence to screw itself to power.” In World Politics Review [  ], James Bosworth recounts two recent political assassination attempts in the region - one against Jair Bolsonaro and one against Cristina Fernández de Kirchner - comparing timelines, motivations, and political effects in an effort to predict the impact the recent shooting at a Trump rally will have on his campaign. “...When U.S. voters cast their ballots come November, this weekend’s assassination attempt against Trump will be just one of many considerations that voters weigh, not the defining feature of the campaign,” he says. Martín Schapiro at Cenital [  ] mentions a few of the various recent acts of political violence in the U.S., including Gabby Giffords, Steve Scalise, and Paul Pelosi, and notes that ever-growing extreme partisanship is making this kind of political violence more and more expected in the country. Argentina wins Copa América amid security failures Argentina beat Colombia 1-0 last night at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami in a thrilling final to become the most decorated national team in Latin America, boasting 16 Copa América titles. Argentina’s Lautaro Martinez scored the game’s only goal in overtime, handing a final victory to Angel Di María, who had announced the Copa América would be his final tournament with the albiceleste. It was also likely one of the final games with Argentina for captain Lionel Messi, who left the pitch in tears with an ankle injury. From a security standpoint, however, the match offered more questions than answers. The combination of fans attempting to enter the stadium without tickets, a lack of security preparations regarding entry to the stadium, and extreme heat resulted in chaos and an 82-minute delay to the start of the match (Buenos Aires Times [  ]). A BBC [  ] video captured fans without tickets crawling through air vents to get into the stadium, while the Athletic [  ] recounts the separation of families at the gates and mid-match stadium ejections. The events called into question U.S. preparedness as the next host of the 2026 World Cup (alongside Mexico and Canada), where 48 teams will come to the northern hemisphere to compete. Fans and pundits were quick to place blame for the chaos, with many pointing to the organization - or lack thereof - by the CONMEBOL, soccer’s governing body in South America, says Forbes [  ]. Though these incidents were the most visible, they joined other organizational issues earlier in the tournament, including clashes between the Uruguayan team and Colombian fans, as well as lack of medical attention or preparedness for referees and fans (Reuters [  ]). Others also blamed CONCACAF (CONMEBOL’s northern counterpart) and the United States, who as hosts were responsible for overseeing the terms laid out by CONMEBOL and for the overall organization of the tournament, and criticized their profound misunderstanding of Latin American soccer culture. Though ultimately the event was able to continue and the worst outcomes were avoided, scenes from outside the stadium served as a wake-up call for the organizers of the World Cup in 2 years’ time, and the Club World Cup next year. Peru Alberto Fujimori, former president of Perú, will seek his third term as president in the 2026 elections despite his failing health and his numerous critical convictions, reports MercoPress [  ]. His daughter Keiko, a former presidential candidate herself, will not be part of his ticket. Venezuela Edmundo González Urrutia, the chosen candidate of Venezuela’s opposition following the banning of their two previous choices, is leading in the polls. He wants to build “a country of prosperity, democracy, and peace” if he is elected, notes the Guardian [  ]. In the Latin America Advisor [  ], experts discuss potential outcomes of a negotiation between the U.S. and the current Maduro regime, ahead of the country’s presidential elections on July 28. The government is attempting to “tilt the playing field,” argues Tamara Taraciuk Broner, while Michael Shifter believes that “The talks are unlikely to have much impact in the short term.” The uncertainty of the outcome of Venezuela’s upcoming elections does not translate into an automatic loss for Maduro, writes Joshua Collins for Pirate Wire Services [  ], believing Maduro will not just step aside in the event of an opposition victory. Argentina In the Buenos Aires Times [  ], Marcelo Garcia questions whether President Milei’s economic theory, that the fiscal deficit is at the root cause of Argentina’s economic problems, is the true problem. Amid a sharp need for additional hard currency, Milei might find himself reverting to policies he has criticized the “caste” for implementing, including another devaluation or a new deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Beginning today (Monday), the central bank will sell U.S. dollars in Argentina’s parallel foreign exchange market, according to Economy Minister Luis Caputo. The parallel exchange market has a difference of almost 500 pesos of the value of the dollar, compared to the government’s official rate (held in place due to currency controls), explains the Buenos Aires Times [  ]. Inflation rose 4.6% in June, up from the 4.2% recorded in May, reports AP News [  ]. The new rate halts the 5-month trend of a steadily decreasing rise in inflation. Brazil The Chamber of Deputies approved the Constitutional Amendment Proposal (PEC of Amnesty) last week, lowering requirements for political parties and for minority candidates - particularly black candidates - to enter politics, reports Folha [  ]. The PEC, which now goes to the Senate, “aims to overturn the Supreme Court decision that obliges parties to distribute the billion-dollar campaign fund proportionally to the number of white and black (black and brown) candidates,” in place since 2020. Cuba John McIntire and Ricardo Herrero assess the voracity of Cuba’s private sector in Americas Quarterly [  ], noting the growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises alongside self-employed entrepreneurs, operating outside of the government’s grasp. Colombia InSight Crime [  ] attributes Colombia’s high rates of deforestation to criminal activity, highlighting how ex-FARC mafia became involved in activities such as illegal mining and logging, which in turn hurt the country’s environment. La Silla Vacía [  ] highlights the swift decrease in Colombia’s biodiversity, and calls for increased societal and government action to help restore the country’s rich environment.

The Russian attack that started on February 24, 2022, took the form of an armored column headed for Kiev. Had the attack occurred 20 years earlier, one can reasonably assume that the Russian force would have reached its target in a matter of hours and imposed on Ukraine a pro-Russian government. ** Second look at India election confirms a sea change ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Smytta Yadav Narendra Modi was sworn in as India’s prime minister on June 9 for a historic third term.

Speculation grows ahead of the Bank of Japan’s July policy meeting, driven by recent wage increases and economic pressures, potentially impacting global markets. ** Violence may be a determining factor for US election ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Jack L. Rozdilsky Recent studies on attitudes toward political violence indicate that a small but not insignificant number of Americans support the idea of using violence to advance political ideas. While Donald Trump has been the victim of a heinous attempted assassination, it’s difficult to ignore how he has catalyzed extreme political polarization by tacitly supporting political violence. ** Biden’s senility, and ours ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Spengler We have met senility, and he is us. It isn’t just poor Joe Biden who has aged ungracefully. The wealthy nations of the world are aging and the consequences will be far more painful than the passing humiliation of one Western leader. Instead of cringing at the president’s agonizing attempts to prove his mental competence, we should look hard in the mirror. ** South Korea aims laser arms at North Korea’s drones ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Gabriel Honrada South Korea is developing laser weapons to counter the threat of North Korean drones. These advanced defense systems are designed to detect and neutralize unmanned aerial vehicles, enhancing South Korea's security capabilities. This underscores Seoul's commitment to protecting its airspace against potential incursions amid a technological arms race on the Korean Peninsula. ** One inch from a potential civil war ( ------------------------------------------------------------ By Arlie Perliger If, indeed, Donald Trump had suffered fatal injuries during his attempted assassination, the level of violence that we witnessed so far would be nothing in comparison to what would have happened in the next couple of months.

Goldman China’s June exports rose 8.6% year-on-year in US dollar terms and 10.7% in RMB, exceeding analysts’ expectations and pointing to higher-than-expected GDP growth for the second quarter. Shipments to Central Asia showed the biggest increase, reflecting China’s buildout of transport and other infrastructure through the Belt and Road Initiative. ** Teesta River project: Should Bangladesh self-fund?

It was followed by a number of important fossil discoveries in the area dubbed the “cradle of humankind”. These finds sparked a debate that rages on today: exactly how old are South Africa’s Australopithecus africanus fossils? Francis Thackeray explains [ how studying the fossilised teeth of hominins (ancient human ancestors) may have provided an answer.

On the road from Canberra to Sydney, there is an enormous lake that is often devoid of water and perfect for staring out over while listening to sad music in a perfect movie scene. Bus drivers used to love to say that when Lake George was empty, a lake in China was full. And when that Chinese lake was empty, George was full. Doesn’t really make sense to me, academically, but vibes feel right, somehow. That’s how I feel about Malaysia and Thailand. When Thailand is on the verge of political chaos, Malaysia relaxes. When Malaysia is gearing up, Thailand takes a break. This week in Bangkok is a rare break — last week the Senate election was (largely) completed and the second round of hearings into Prime Minister Srettha Thaivisin’s future and that of the Move Forward won’t be back in court until next week. So, take a seat Thailand. Let Malaysia have this week.

Support Dari Mulut ke Mulut ( Erin Cook PS I think this week’s episode of Reformasi with Kevin O’Rourke is extra good! We chatted with Nenden Sekar Arum at SAFEnet, an Indonesian group advocating for digital rights and cyber-safety. We began with the big data hack story but Nenden was very generous and let us pepper her with all sorts of tech/digital/online questions! Ransomware or Randomware? Indonesia\\'s Bizarre National Data Hack (with Nenden Sekar Arum): ( ——————————————————————————— ## 🇵🇭 Alice Guo is gone — once authorities can find her Arrest suspended Bamban mayor, Alice Guo. That’s the order from the Senate on Saturday after the embattled politico “unduly [refused] to appear, despite due notices,” to a Senate probe into Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators last week, [Rappler reports]( It comes after the Court of Appeals [granted a petition]( from the Anti-Money Laundering Council to freeze her assets on Thursday. Acquaintances and family are also named in warrants. Guo’s former accountant Nancy Gamo was nabbed Saturday afternoon and could be held by the Senate for as long as the POGO probe takes, [Rappler notes]( Sen. Risa Hontiveros, who is a leading senate critic of POGOs and who catapulted Guo to national infamy with her questioning of Guo’s biographical details, has called on Guo to turn herself in, saying dodging authorities isn’t really helping her case. Hontiveros, of course, gave Guo a public pummelling for the ages back in May when she disputed much of Guo’s life story, including finding that Guo may not be a Filipino national at all and instead a Chinese national. This came after a March raid on offices partially owned by Guo, raising questions initially about the providence of Guo’s money and business interests and, eventually, the providence of Guo herself. The key for now, however, is that Guo is alleged to be deeply involved in POGOs, a notoriously shady industry in which companies based in the Philippines operate online gambling sites targeting those abroad. Hontiveros and a hell of a lot of Filipinos aren’t enormous fans of the industry and this senate inquiry is aimed at shining some light on what exactly is going on with them. Guo is scared to front up to the Senate, her lawyers say. She’s been the victim of [intimidation and death threats]( and is suffering unidentified health issues that are exacerbating trauma, lawyer [Stephen David said in comments published by PhilStar last week]( that, on review now, kinda make it clear she was going to dodge. For Hontiveros, “the issuance of the arrest order is only the first step to making Mayor Alice Guo or Guo Hua Ping accountable to our laws,” she said in a statement Saturday, [as per the Inquirer]( “Of all the lies and possible crimes of Mayor Alice and all involved in POGO, this is not merely procedural. This arrest order upholds the mandate of the Senate to safeguard the well-being of Filipinos.” This week I’ll be glued to the Inquirer and Rappler for updates. ## 🇻🇳 It won’t go dark in Vietnam, government promises Northern Vietnam is ready and waiting for heatwaves to hit the area and for the electronic hub, home to factories for Apple and Samsung, electricity stability is crucial. Vietnam Electricity Group says it expects peak demand to hit more than 27,000 megawatts this month. Northern Vietnam copped blackouts last year during the same period, in part due to malfunctions at coal-fired plants, [Bloomberg reports]( Stay cool, everyone. ## 🇮🇩 Indonesia to claw back data After last month’s cataclysmic hack on a national data centre, Indonesian authorities say they’re now in the process of getting back data. More than 160 government agencies were affected by the ransomware attack, in which Brain Cipher demanded US$8 million to hand it back over — though they then apologised and released a decryption key. The whole thing is still very strange to me, listen to last week’s Reformasi for more. “The communications ministry is using a decryption strategy to recover services or assets from ministries, state agencies, and the regional governments that are affected. We are handling this gradually,” Chief Security Minister Hadi Tjahjanto said in a statement, [as per Reuters]( ## 🇲🇾 Political intrigue in Malaysia is back After a few months of [poor by-election results]( for the Anwar Ibrahim government, intrigue is back in Malaysia. It may well be the base state of Malaysia in the post-Najib years, but, despite some major hiccups in recent months, things have been relatively solid. But holy smokes are we back! Last week, Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Johari Abdul declared six Bersatu MPs could hold onto their seats despite being booted from the party. This particular calamity — at least from former PM and Bersatu boss Muhyddin Yassin’s perspective — has reignited the party-hopping legislation, which was passed back in 2022 in an effort to stem the tide of MPs jumping all over the place in an endless permutation of coalitions. Article 49A of the law states an MP will lose their office if they ‘resign’ or ‘cease to be’ a member of their party but, [according to the Malay Mail]( it also states that if an MP is purged from the party they can keep their seat. Bersatu, aware of this loophole, didn’t purge the members but rather rewrote party rules to ‘ceasing’ membership. Good try but no go, said the Speaker. While Muhyiddin stews and plots, commentators and analysts worry about where this is going to go next. If other parties change their constitutions to dodge Article 49A, could Malaysia be looking at a constitutional crisis? Pakatan Harapan’s comms director Fahmi Fadzil has played down questions that the government is nervous about what six by-elections would mean if the MPs were booted in the end. “This is not a matter of being afraid or not afraid [of elections]. This is about the constitution,” he told media, [as reported by Bernama]( This is going to take a long time to shake out, I bet, but I’d still wager we’ve got a busy week of statements and hot takes ahead. ### Interesting reads [Thai banks admit lack of capacity to investigate Myanmar weapon payments]( (Reuters) Major Thai banks defended themselves on Thursday against criticism that they facilitated weapons purchases by the Myanmar junta, saying they lacked the capacity to investigate all transactions that may be used for such purchases.

In March, Song Yancheng, of Hock Kee Fried Kway Teow, also died. His specialty was a wok-fried flat noodle dish featuring cockles, eggs and a distinctive smoky aroma.

The deaths of the two noodle masters — and tales of other hawkers retiring without successors — have spurred a round of soul-searching in Singapore about its street food heritage.

In this spirit, I would like to share with you my new work on the complex impact that commercial, political, and other engagement with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has had on democracy in the countries of Latin America, to which U.S. security and prosperity is bound by ties of geography, commerce and family. By contrast to the Soviet Union, which fought during the Cold War to undermine democracies through military and political subversion, this work examines the more indirect, but equally grave threats presented to the region through: (1) the influence of Chinese “training programs” for Latin American journalists, police, government officials and others in the region; (2) the subversive example off PRC privileging of the State over democratic voice and protection of the individual in its governance model and technology solutions, and: (3) the impact of Chinese commercial and other “no questions asked” (as long as Chinese companies are protected) support as an “incubator” of authoritarianism, helping populist governments to survive as they consolidate power and dismantle legal constraints and protections within their own societies.

Opposition rallies across the country are packed, even in former Chavista strongholds, despite government attempts to make them as difficult as possible, such as arresting campaign workers [  ], fining restaurants and hotels who provide services to candidates or their staff, and even closing roads [  ] to make the events as difficult as possible. The airwaves are saturated with ads supporting the Maduro government, and the only mention of opposition candidates across the country are the President's attacks on them— claims they are undermining the “Bolivarian Revolution”, the leftist political revolution of Hugo Chávez that Maduro claims to represent. But despite the obstacles, many within Venezuela are beginning to feel a sensation that they have not felt in years— that a real possibility for change may be just around the corner. Polling is notoriously unreliable in Venezuela, due to unethical polling companies that often serve more as arms of political campaigns than neutral organizations, as well as self-censorship of voters themselves who may be reluctant to be honest about their political opinions in a country that has long oppressed or imprisoned dissidents— especially after a new “Anti-Hate Law [  ]” was passed in 2017 that allows for prison sentences of up to 20 years for those who speak out against the government [  ]. But some polls show the current opposition presidential candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia. 30 to 50 points ahead of Maduro [  ], despite the fact that before the current elections, few Venezuelans knew who has was— an expression of the amount of support Maduro has lost since the country was plunged into an economic and political crisis which resulted in nearly 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country since 2014. Even some of Maduro’s former political allies, such as the Venezuelan Communist Party, have also withdrawn their support and publicly announced they would back another candidate [  ]. Urrutia took over the campaign after the two previous candidates were disqualified from running by the government. Right-wing candidate Maria Corina Machado won the opposition’s primary in October 2023 with 93% of the vote [  ] but was banned from running. As was her appointed successor Corina Yoris. She has since thrown her support [  ] fully behind González, holding rallies across the country calling for an end to the Maduro government. Maduro, who took power after the death of Chávez in 2013, has held power for a decade and is seeking another 6-year term as president. Previous elections in the country were plagued with irregularities, and criticized by both the European Union and the Organization of American States in Latin America.

To receive new posts and support our work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Current elections were organized in response to the “Barbados Agreement [  ]”, which occurred in October 2023, between Maduro’s government and the opposition and mediated by representatives from Norway. Among other points, the accord stipulated that new Presidential elections would be organized by late 2024, and would include election observers from the European Union. Although the United States was not a direct party to the negotiations, they scaled back some oil sanctions on Venezuela as an incentive to stick to the agreement. Venezuela has since uninvited EU election observers as well as broken promises not to arrest members of opposition political parties. It is impossible to predict what will happen after the elections, but in the case of an opposition victory, it is quite possible that Maduro will refuse to step down— and his administration has a host of tools at its disposal to avoid doing so. “I think the administration of Maduro is facing a tough choice,” Tony Frangie Mawad, a journalist in Caracas told PWS. “They could choose to impose a full transition from an autocracy to a Nicaragua-style dictatorship crackdown,” to prevent a loss. Or “they could try further indirect election influence, or even canceling the elections,” he continued. Ultimately though, Mawad doesn’t believe Maduro is likely to simply step aside. Some analysts have suggested that unprecedented support could strongly weaken his support among allies, or inspire widespread protests in the streets. But Maduro has been underestimated by political analysts, both domestic and international, before. Some Venezuelans have described their feelings [  ] about the elections as “a see-saw between hope and fear”. Leftist leaders in the country have also pressured Maduro to respect election results. President Lula, in Brazil, has on multiple occasions called on the Venezuelan government to fulfill their obligations under the Barbados Agreement. Petro, in Colombia, has announced that the country will not send election observers for a host of reasons, among them that Colombia “does not want to give the appearance of legitimizing elections.” In the same statement, Colombia repeated previous calls for the U.S. to end sanctions against Venezuela. Boric, in Chile, has often criticized Venezuela’s human rights record and called for truly free elections in the country. Both the United Nations and Human Rights Watch have criticized increasingly authoritarian crackdowns [  ] by the Venezuelan government ahead of elections. Meanwhile, the Maduro campaign has swung into full action. Members of his party are organizing voter organization drives, pledging to ensure that every member will ensure that at least 10 friends and relatives likely to vote for Maduro make it to the polls. The government has also staged rallies in Caracas, and invited journalists and influencers sympathetic to the government to come to the country ahead of elections, which he has framed as a defense of the Bolivarian Revolution and a “struggle against Imperialism”. Meanwhile, most of those Venezuelans living abroad will be excluded from casting a ballot, both due to onerous restrictions about foreign residents voting, and a lack of government infrastructure where the majority of them live. Venezuelan embassies in the United States and Colombia were closed years ago, leaving many in the diaspora disenfranchised. Nonetheless, some of them are hopeful. Javier Guerrero, a Venezuelan artist in Medellin, when asked about his feelings on elections, replied “I don’t know what is going to happen. But this is the first time I’ve seen some Colectivos (social organizations created by Chávez, some of which act as informal militia), abandoning him.” “This is the first time I see doubt from some of his traditional supporters,” he continued. Guerrero, however, stopped short of predicting an outcome. “Venezuela has proven over and over that it is anything but predictable. I just hope that if Maduro does finally leave office, something I personally hope to see in my lifetime, that we don’t just swing immediately to the far-right in a reactionary manner as a result.” The Big Headlines in LATAM As of Saturday evening, even Latin American news sites were dominated by the news of the assassination attempt of U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump. The fledgling democracy, which in recent years has been plagued by political instability and coup attempts, suffered another blow as one of its two octogenarian candidates from the elite upper classes was wounded when a shooter fired at him during a campaign event. Most political analysts from the capital, called Washington D.C., were quick to call for an end to violence. Some international observers, however, questioned whether events such as this may be “the new normal.” Many leaders from more civilized countries, in Latin America, offered messages of support for the ex-reality T.V. star turned ex-president, and condemned the assassination attempt. There was no immediate news on whether a U.N-led peacekeeping mission would be deployed until order can be restored. Ha! Sorry, we’re being a bit tongue-in-cheek here. We thought it might be funny to cover U.S. events in the tone many international media companies cover our own beats here in LATAM. In other news, Colombia squares off against Argentina today in the semi-finals of the American Cup. This, sadly, pits PWS members against PWS members. But we promise to be civilized about it no matter who wins. Spanish Word of the Week Enchufados An enchufado, in Venezuelan slang, is someone who has an enchufe, a source of power. The simplest translation to English might be “someone who is plugged in”. Corruption in Venezuela is endemic. Transparency International rates it at 177th out of 180 countries in the world [  ]. Those who benefit from that corruption, or their family members, are often called enchufados. An entire Enchufado culture has emerged in Caracas in recent years, with young influencers with powerful family members posting images of their lavish lifestyles [  ] on social media, and driving demand for luxury goods, even as millions suffer from extreme economic crisis.

In Foreign Policy [  ], Christopher Sabatini chronicles the efforts the Maduro government has taken to turn the upcoming elections - “one which represents the best possibility for Venezuelans’ hopes for change in recent memory” - in its favor and discredit any potential unfavorable outcome, despite outcry from the opposition and the international community. Some actions taken by the government include Maduro’s face appearing 13 times on the ballot, compared to the other nine candidates, whose faces show up once or twice, explains AP News [  ]. The government also disqualified popular opposition candidate Maria Corina Machado from running, and later disqualified her chosen successor, Corina Yoris, as well. Former diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia will represent the unified opposition on the ballot. The Washington Post [  ] editorial board calls for increased and constant attention from the international community in calling for a free and fair election, arguing that “This might be Venezuela’s last, and best, chance to end a generation of misrule.” “For better or worse, the election scheduled for July 28 will change Venezuela, with outsized implications for the United States and the entire Western Hemisphere,” write Andrés Gluski and Susan Segal in Americas Quarterly [  ], noting previous (and potentially ongoing) negotiations with the U.S. regarding the lifting of sanctions on the Venezuelan oil sector. “July 28 now looks like an inevitable transition to something else,” they say, laying out possible scenarios depending on the electoral outcome. CSIS’ [  ] Ryan Berg and Alexandra Winkler deep dive into four potential scenarios before, after, and during election day. The Economist [  ] emphasizes the closeness of this election, which stands to end over a decade of increasingly undemocratic rule of the country. More Venezuela Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua as a transnational criminal organization and imposed sanctions on the group, says Reuters [  ]. Colombian police, alongside the U.S. Embassy in Colombia, announced up to a $12 million reward for “information leading to the arrests and/or convictions in any country” of the group’s leaders, according to El País [  ]. Brazil Federal police have issued five preliminary arrest warrants for a “criminal organization” that allegedly operated from within Brazil’s intelligence agency during the Bolsonaro administration to illegally spy on legislators, journalists, and members of the judiciary, reports AP News [  ]. According to the Guardian [  ], the long-standing investigation found that the agency was used to spy on political rivals and/or those who sought to uphold the country’s democratic institutions. Mexico President-Elect Claudia Sheinbaum has chosen Lazaro Cardenas to be her chief of staff once she takes office. Cardenas, a former congressman and governor, is “an icon of the Mexican left,” says Reuters [  ]. The Guardian [  ] highlights the slow but steady decline of state-owned oil company Pemex, and notes how government efforts to increase the company’s productivity have come at the expense of certain renewable energy initiatives. Climate expert and President-Elect Claudia Sheinbaum has the opportunity to push for an energy transition, but her platform may not be compatible with the policies of her mentor, outgoing president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, says the Washington Post [  ]. Haiti In the Miami Herald [  ], Jennie Murray argues in favor of adjustments to the U.S. immigration system, including pausing deportations to Haiti, to help Haitians fleeing their country’s crisis. Uruguay The country’s fiscal deficit, registered at 4.4%, is comparable to levels from 2019 when the previous administration held office, reports MercoPress [  ]. The failure by the current administration to improve certain economic indicators, of which the fiscal deficit was a primary campaign promise, could affect the outcome of the upcoming presidential elections.

He has hardly any competition given the expulsion of opposition candidates and the silencing of critics. Despite a win being all but certain, AI-powered accounts have been flooding discussions of the upcoming poll, praising Kagame’s candidacy and stifling critical posts. Morgan Wack explains [ how these accounts are manipulating perceptions and spreading propaganda. Ahead of the 15 July vote, we have put together a series of articles [ from our academics that go deeper into Rwanda’s political landscape – and Kagame’s place in it. Brenda Fassie is still a loved and controversial figure in South Africa even 20 years after her death. The “queen of African pop” had a string of hits over three decades - among them the politically charged Black President and the wedding celebration anthem Vulindlela. Fassie was also an original slay queen and a rebellious queer black woman, writes [ pop culture scholar Mbali Mazibuko. She offers a deeper reading of Vulindlela to explain the political significance of black women like Fassie. Kagure Gacheche Commissioning Editor, East Africa AI propaganda campaign in Rwanda has been pushing pro-Kagame messages – a dangerous new trend in Africa [ Morgan Wack, Clemson University The methods used to manipulate perceptions and hold on to power in Africa are getting increasingly sophisticated. Brenda Fassie’s 1997 hit song Vulindlela still raises questions about South Africa as a nation [ Mbali Mazibuko, University of Johannesburg Released in 1997, Vulindlela reflects the optimism of a democratic South Africa – but Fassie’s ‘bad girl’ image also asks who is really welcome in this new society.

The reform, initially approved in December, was then sent to a special working group in the lower house, which discussed specific regulations for each sector of the economy. Yesterday, representatives voted on the documents presented by the working group (BN Americas [  ]). The Brazilian Report [  ]offers a detailed overview of the proposed tax reforms. In particular, the bill proposes merging five different taxes into one “value-added tax (VAT),” with different rates at the national and regional levels. A maximum rate of 26.5% was established for the overall consumption tax. The bill also proposes “a tax on products considered harmful to the environment or human health, like cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.” (Reuters [  ]) Various industries are concerned about tax increases and levies, including the infrastructure and mining industries, and those in the water and sanitation sector, explained BN Americas [  ]. These increases could also lead to increases in consumer prices in the long term. The bill will then be sent to the Senate for another vote. More Brazil Prolonged droughts are expected in Brazil through November, setting off alarm bells among Brazilian regulators and government agencies who are worried the lack of water could result in significant power outages across the Amazon, reports Brazilian Report [  ]. Venezuela Maria Corina Machado, the main figure of the Venezuelan opposition, has been banned from running in the upcoming elections. Her continued influence, however, could still play an important role among citizens, says Bloomberg [  ]. Colombia In a speech, Colombian President Gustavo Petro asked for international assistance on issues related to the Amazon jungle or drug trafficking in an effort to further advance with the agreement signed between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), reports Prensa Latina [  ]. The outcome of Venezuela’s election could have profound impacts on Colombia’s future, writes Ronal F. Rodriguez for La Silla Vacía [  ]. Increased migration from Venezuelans has caused Colombia’s government to address security and welfare issues, among others, more than any other country affected by the Venezuelan crisis. Haiti The U.S. Institute of Peace [  ] published a report on how Colombia and Guatemala’s transitional restorative justice model and hybrid prosecution system, respectively, could offer lessons for Haiti as it seeks to find a way out of its current turmoil. Chile Homelessness in Chile has risen more than 30% over the last four years, reports AP News [  ], a sharp increase for “a country considered far wealthier and more stable than its neighbors.” El Salvador Cristosal, a human rights organization in El Salvador, reported that at least 261 people have died in prison during the country’s state of emergency, implemented by President Nayib Bukele in 2022 to crack down on gangs, says AP News [  ]. Argentina The Regime of Incentives for Large Investments (RIGI), a bill awaiting final approval in Congress, has the potential to attract significant investments in Argentina’s oil and gas industry. However, environmentalists point out that the bill would signal the end of any serious effort towards energy transition and could have severe effects on the environment, says the Guardian [  ]. New measures to the transport sector industry, including allowing for easier industry entry for new operators as well as a deregulation of certain procedures at airports, has spurred immediate pushback from labor groups, says the Buenos Aires Times [  ]. Internal divisions within the ruling La Libertad Avanza (LLA) party have made their way to the highest levels within the party, with Vice President Victoria Villarruel half-heartedly participating in some of Milei’s initiatives amid disagreements with General Secretary of the Presidency Karina Milei, writes Pablo Ibánez in Cenital [  ]. Regional Shannon O’Neil writes about Latin America’s decreasing economic growth as a cause of stagnant urban productivity and falling Chinese investment, among others, for the Council on Foreign Relations [  ]. A Colombia win over Uruguay in last night’s Copa América match won them a spot in the finals for the first time in years. Colombia will face reigning champion Argentina on Sunday in Miami.

A few weeks ago I split the Myanmar newsletter into two with a focus on Myanmar from the inside and then Myanmar from the outside.

Myanmar newsletters will stay free for all readers for as long as they have to, and that’s very much thanks to premium readers whose subscriptions make that possible.

The report found international sanctions have slowed down the junta’s ability to move money around and buy arms — a claim the junta has long downplayed, [Reuters reports]( Singaporean business ties to the junta were an immediate focus for the people’s resistance movement in the early days of the coup which aimed to pile pressure on private companies to step back. Last year, following a similar report from the UN, the government launched an investigation that eventually saw a crackdown and a major reduction in military exports to Myanmar, [Nikkei Asia reports]( This most recent report hopes it will exert the same pressure on Bangkok. “If the government of Thailand were to respond to this information as the government of Singapore did one year ago, the SAC's ability to attack the people of Myanmar would be significantly impaired,” the report noted. Interestingly, banks and governments elsewhere were largely responsive to enquiries but Thailand was a notable unreturned call. Nikkei Asia reports both the enormous Siam Commercial Bank and the Thai government itself were not interested in participating. Looking more broadly at [Thai-Myanmar relations for Fulcrum]( Paul Chambers and Kridsana Chotisut write that the economic futures of both countries are ‘intricately linked.’ The pair breaks down business links across the border that account for both massive trade and some very dodgy wheeling and dealing, including involvement in some of the notorious scam centres. These links are historical and tied up in the military, making things difficult for the Thai civilian government. ‘One of the most difficult challenges facing Thailand’s Myanmar policy is that recent Thai military officers (and traditional politicians) have had affable relations with Myanmar state officials making it hard to deal with anti-state actors. The Thai army especially prefers to collaborate with the Myanmar army: senior officers from the two countries meet regularly in the promotion of defence diplomacy.’ This is, of course, long an issue in relations but given the shift in power and, crucially, the return of a meddling Thaksin Shinawatra, things are strained. ‘According to a source close to the Thai military, senior military officials were infuriated because the government had them out of the loop about Thaksin’s peace forays,’ Chambers and Chotisut write. It’s not just big-money collaboration. The Thai Ministry of Labour last week flagged the imminent closure of all centres issuing Certificates of Identification across the country. These certificates have allowed people from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos to move around legally and safely in Thailand after receiving a job offer. The ministry cited a request from Myanmar as behind the move, [Myanmar Now reports]( Whether it’s a short-term move or a permanent shift in policy remains to be seen. Moe Kyaw, the associate secretary of the Thailand-based Yaung Chi Oo Workers Association, told Myanmar Now that if the ‘pink card’ job permit is reformed to allow workers to move more freely then it could be a good move, but we’ll see! ## 🇨🇳 A couple of visits to Beijing raise eyebrows, arms concerns Who needs Bangkok when you’ve got Beijing? [The Irrawaddy reports this week]( that arms purchases are set to arrive in Myanmar from China within a month, citing sources in the capital and along the border. “The [regime’s] shopping list is long and huge arms caches are on the way to Myanmar,” the sources told the outlet. The report comes as the junta’s number two in command, Soe Win, visits China following a June trip by former president Thein Sein. [Leong Wai Kit at Channel News Asia]( has an intriguing explainer here that looks at the various rumours and which is most likely. There are a lot of interesting bits in here, but the line that a source said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi ‘had asked Thein Sein to persuade Min Aung Hlaing to hand over power and form an interim government to pave the way for elections’ sure got me. Similarly, curious to hear that Operation 1027 had derailed plans earlier in the year: “Beijing intended to engage deputy army chief Soe Win and would have invited him to China in the first quarter of the year. But back then, (military chief) Min Aung Hlaing had trust issues with Soe Win — that disrupted the engagement effort and China’s invitation. Meanwhile, via the diplomatic track (of) engagement, Thein Sein was able to make the trip to Beijing on Jun 28,” a source told CNA. The Irrawaddy’s position is that the visit for Soe Win is timed with a [resurgence in fighting in Shan State]( which borders China, and is squarely about arms procurement. Sure, he’s ostensibly there for the Green Development Forum at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, but I did like Leong Wai Kit’s line about China’s use of multilaterals to engage the Myanmar junta without too much fuss. [Very intriguing report here from Nikkei Asia]( about a digital crackdown on dissent using Chinese tech. Research and digital rights group Justice For Myanmar alleged Chinese company Geedge Networks and state-owned China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation are behind the junta’s online surveillance operations. The group warns that the junta is building “a digital dictatorship” that monitors and censors widely in an effort to shut down dissent. VPNs have long been in the crosshairs of the regime and this piece follows an interesting thread on how vital the tools are for businesses still trying to operate in the country. Great read from Thompson Chau, as usual! ## 🇺🇸 A caucus and a potential pivot Washington DC isn’t one to be left out, it seems. [The Diplomat cites a source]( with knowledge of the events who says Daniel Kritenbrink, the US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs (that’s a long business card), met with Myanmar Navy commander Kyaw Lin Zaw while in Hanoi on June 21 and 22. That visit was meant to be a post-Putin ‘hey, Vietnam, remember us’ but this does seem to be far juicier. The US State Department would not confirm or deny the visit but noted the US would continue “to deploy all diplomatic tools” to pressure the junta, [the Irrawaddy reports]( Meanwhile, Congress launched the Burma Caucus at the end of last month. The Caucus aims to “bolster congressional support for the Burmese people in their fight for democracy and human rights against the brutal military junta,” founders Betty McCollum and Bill Huizenga said in a statement.

The authors argue that the U.S. Southern Command is seeking to fill the gap of the U.S.’ lack of political and economic engagement with the region, placing undue and unnecessary emphasis on the U.S. military. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva traveled to Bolivia for the first time in his third administration to meet with his counterpart Luis Arce, reports MercoPress [  ]. The two leaders discussed security issues including human trafficking and migration, as well as for shared healthcare access. President Lula also rejected allegations that the recent coup in Bolivia was staged by Arce himself in order to gain electoral support, says El País [  ]. For the first time in 28 years, the joint declaration issued by Mercosur members did not mention Argentina’s sovereignty claim over the Malvinas Islands, in a notable rebuke against President Milei’s decision to not attend the bloc summit in Paraguay. (Buenos Aires Herald [  ]) Latin American markets could be affected by a Donald Trump win in November, assesses Reuters [  ]. Mexico’s deep economic relationship with the U.S. and the issue of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela are both areas that could be impacted. Trump’s personal relationship with El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele and Argentina’s Javier Milei could also play a role in U.S. policy towards the region. In Americas Quarterly [  ], Eduardo Levy Yeyati argues in favor of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in Latin America, believing it could “equalize wages downward while further reducing labor’s share of income.” However, he notes that the region is not currently prepared for widespread AI adoption, highlighting “rigid and outdated education systems, below-average math and reading scores, scarce and unequal digital connectivity, and limited vocational training and reskilling programs due to widespread precarity and informality.” Also in Americas Quarterly [  ], Lucia Dammert highlights the increasing entanglement between organized crime and politics in the region, noting that corruption, lack of transparency, and fragile institutions are key characteristics for criminal organizations to continue growing. Migration More than nine hundred thousand migrants, of the total ~2.5 million registered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in 2023, came from just six countries in Latin America. “Push factors—including organized crime-fueled violence and extortion and a lack of economic opportunities—combined with the pull of a strong U.S. labor market, make it unlikely migration flows will decrease substantially in the near future,” write Will Freeman, Steven Holmes, and Sabine Baumgartner for Council on Foreign Relations [  ]. A New York Times [  ] article chronicles the journey, fraught with economic hardships and danger, of one family as they traveled from Venezuela to New York City over the course of a year. Venezuela The New York Times [  ] reports on the situation of Venezuelan citizens who have fled their country, and are now encountering difficulties registering to vote in Venezuela’s upcoming elections. “The government’s tactics are tantamount to sweeping electoral fraud, election experts say.” AP News [  ] offers an overview on the logistics of Venezuela’s upcoming elections. Mexico Over 20 former heads of state from Latin America have rejected outgoing Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s proposed judicial reform, reports Animal Político [  ]. AMLO’s successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, has indicated that she would continue to push for the reform once she takes office. Intentional homicides have increased 2 percent in the first semester in Mexico when compared to the same period last year, according to La Jornada [  ]. It is the first time in six years that this figure has increased. Argentina On Tuesday, Argentina’s independence day, Milei signed a long-delayed 10-point pact with provincial governors in an effort to rally support for his economic plans, says Reuters [  ]. Argentina’s independence day, celebrated July 9, saw both President Javier Milei and Vice President Victoria Villarruel riding through the City of Buenos Aires on an Army tank, reports MercoPress [  ]. Cointelegraph [  ] reports a surge in crypto adoption in Argentina amid a 276% inflation rate. Interestingly, analysts note that Argentines tend to purchase stablecoins like USDT and just hold them in their accounts, rather than spending them. Regional Will Freeman analyzes the differences in democratic capabilities at the national and subnational levels across Latin America. Organized crime and corruption, he argues, play a significant role in towns, cities, or states in otherwise democratic countries.

The group, turned political party, soon took over Rwanda’s governance and has been in power since. Its leader, Paul Kagame, became president in April 2000 and looks set to extend his rule in elections next week. How has a ruling Tutsi minority been perceived in a country with a Hutu majority? Réginas Ndayiragije and Marijke Verpoorten set out [ to answer this question. In South Africa, it’s not unusual for musicians – even famous ones – to die in poverty. Often that’s blamed on their “lifestyles”. But a new study highlights how underpaid musicians are in the country, especially considering what it costs them to do their jobs.

Read more Far-right Patriots group springs to third force in European Parliament Viktor Orbán’s nationalist 'Patriots for Europe' group has been officially established in the European Parliament today, boasting 84 MEPs making it the third-largest group in the hemicycle. What does the French left-wing alliance’s shock election win mean for Europe? Experts say the anti-far-right bulwark has safeguarded the European bloc from a political shock. Why did the Russian disinformation machine target French voters? For the Kremlin, the National Rally — whose stances on Russia are friendlier than those of President Macron, a staunch supporter of Ukraine — might have been the preferred winners of the French snap legislative elections, and Moscow likely tried to help boost their results on Sunday.

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro — indicted just days ago in a case involving an attempt to embezzle jewelry gifted by Saudi Arabia — hosted rightwing luminaries, including Argentine President Javier Milei and Chilean politician José Antonio Kast. (Bloomberg [  ]) El Salvador’s justice and security minister, Gustavo Villatoro, credited with the Bukele administration’s mano dura gang policy was also in attendance. Brazil’s far right is hoping to leverage municipal elections in October to wage a comeback after defeat in the 2022 presidential elections, reports El País [  ]. Bolsonaro spoke on Saturday (before the French elections) and said the right was gaining ground internationally, in Italy and France, and said he hoped that former U.S. President Donald Trump will be returned to the White House this year, reports Reuters. Milei spoke to the conference on Sunday. It was his first visit to Brazil, Argentina’s most important trade partner, since taking office in December. He said criminal cases against Bolsonaro amount to political persecution, and warned of the evils of socialism. However, Milei avoided criticizing Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in his speech — amid media reports that Brazilian diplomats were considering pulling the country’s Buenos Aires ambassador if Milei repeated harsh insults against the leftist leader. Milei opted to skip today’s Mercosur meeting in Paraguay — a snub to the trade bloc, and to Lula, who has demanded an apology from Argentina’s leader. Experts say he has passed up a chance to defuse tensions with Brazil, reports the Associated Press [  ]. “He seems to be shooting himself in the foot,” Michael Shifter, a scholar of Latin America at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, said of Milei. “It’s shocking and counterproductive for him to thumb his nose at Lula in this way because there could be a lot of cost for Argentina, that could affect his ability to carry out his policies.” Milei’s absence adds to a sense of uncertainty regarding Mercosur’s future, reports the Associated Press [  ]. “Argentina is promoting a new foreign economic policy, strategically focused on freedom,” Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino told her counterparts in Paraguay. “If it’s not possible to advance as Mercosur, let’s think about the possibility of having bilateral agreements.” Regional Relations The U.S. Biden administration has relied on its military too much in its relations with Latin America, a mistake given Washington’s political and social concerns in the region, argue Laura Tedesco and Rut Diamint in Americas Quarterly [  ]. “Chinese influence in Latin American energy is large and impactful, ambiguous, and potentially risky in certain contexts,” according to the Atlantic Council [  ]. Migration Boom [  ] — a new site dedicated to opinion that aims to become a hub for the exchange of ideas in Latin America — launched this weekend with a focus on migration in the Darién and beyond. El Maldito Darién [  ] is a documentary short that follows a group of migrants who risk their lives to cross the Darién Gap, the feared stretch of jungle separating Central and South America across the border between Panama and Colombia — Boom [  ] I also wrote about the Darién, for Cenital [  ]: Panama’s new president wants to unilaterally shut down migration across the border and has a new agreement with the U.S. to deport people who make it across — but experts say the plan is unlikely to work, rather repression of one path tends to push migrants to seek more dangerous routes. On Friday Colombian authorities said Panama’s shutdown — barbed wire shutdown three of the main migrant paths out of the Darién — was not agreed with Colombia and poses a humanitarian risk, reports Infobae [  ]. (See last Tuesday’s post [  ].) El Mostrador [  ] highlights the challenges faced by migrant children crossing the desert border from Bolivia into Chile, explaining that “Chile does not have any specialized protection model for migrant children.” (Via Americas Migration Brief [  ]) Juan Martínez d’Aubuisson writes about the netherworld of Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic, where officials and many members of the general population view them as “animals.” (Boom [  ]) Haiti Evidence in a U.S. court case reveal for the first time that political rivals of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse met with gang leaders to request their help in a plot to assassinate Moïse, three years ago. While the gang leaders ultimately did not play a role in the killing, “Moïse’s death did create a power vacuum that allowed hundreds of gangs to terrorize Haitians in one of the nation’s most violent and destabilizing periods,” reports the Miami Herald [  ]. El Salvador Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele threatened to deploy his infamous gang-crackdown policies — presumably indiscriminate detention — against price gougers. “Well, I’m going to issue a message to the importers, distributors and food wholesalers: stop abusing the people of El Salvador, or don’t complain about what happens afterward,” he said Friday. (Associated Press [  ]) Colombia The case of a group of former FARC rebels who became tour guides after laying down arms, and who are now threatened by dissident guerrilla factions, is an example of the failures of the landmark 2016 peace deal, reports the Guardian [  ]. Mexico Mexican president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum should address rampant cartel violence by targeting the most violent gang players and hotspots, as well as addressing an epidemic of extorsion, as she embarks on ambitious social and environmental reform, argues security expert Ioan Grillo in Boom [  ]. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is gearing up to be the most powerful lame duck president in history leveraging a super majority in Congress for a final attempt at sweeping constitutional reform, argues James Bosworth in World Politics Review [  ]. Argentina Also in Boom [  ], Juan Elman interviews Augustín Romo, one of the young influencers whose digital activism helped alchemize the incipient new rightwing in Argentina a few years ago into the movement that catapulted Milei to the presidency. “Well, what we saw through social networks was that before the president decided to get into politics, I\\'m talking about 2019, there were more people on the right than was thought. Even many Peronists, who did not agree that if an 8-year-old boy says that she is a girl, she should give him hormones and cut off his penis, do you understand me?” Brazil “Brazil’s ministry of foreign affairs has been forced to apologize to the embassies of Canada, Gabon and Burkina Faso after three diplomats’ teenage children – all of whom are Black – were searched at gunpoint by police officers,” reports the Guardian [  ]. For the public and experts, case is yet another example of racist practices by Brazilian police. “A recent report found that, in 2022, of the more than 1,300 people killed by the police in Rio, 87% were Black, a figure far above the proportion of Afro-Brazilians in the state’s population, which is 58%.” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reinstated a special commission created to probe dictatorship-era rights violations, which had been dissolved by Bolsonaro, reports AFP [  ]. Regional At least 16 of the 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries are involved in about 50 major new oil and gas onshore and offshore projects, reports the Guardian [  ]. “Even if the world market for fossil fuels starts shrinking by the end of the decade, countries like Brazil, Guyana, Argentina, Ecuador, Mexico and Suriname are betting on oil as a source of wealth, economic growth and development – despite its impact on the planet and thanks to the international community’s inertia in “transitioning away” from the oil era.” The Amazon faces intense droughts and flooding due to global warming — Marcia Nunes Macedo argues for conservation efforts to contemplate water’s role in regional and global weather pattern stability. — Boom [  ] Caribbean islands devastated by Hurricane Beryl last week could take years to recover economically, according to United Nations representatives. (Miami Herald [  ]) \"The earliest Category 5 ever recorded for the Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl’s “arrival jarred Caribbean leaders, who cited concerns about climate change and increased need for aid,” reports the Washington Post [  ]. Ecuador A “court in Ecuador has ruled that pollution has violated the rights of a river that runs through the country’s capital, Quito,” a decision hailed as historic by environmental activists, reports the Associated Press [  ]. Critter Corner Brazil’s appetite for shark is putting pressure on several species. “Brazilian law does not allow fishing for any sharks, but they can be landed as bycatch with few restrictions,” reports the Guardian [  ].

The article is based on my April 2024 trip to the country, and meetings with senior government officials, security experts, academics, and others in the country. I argue that the success and security of Paraguay, which often receives little attention in Washington D.C., is far more strategically important than is recognized. The country is severely stressed by its location on one of South America’s key narcotrafficking routes, making it of particular interest to major transnational criminal organizations in neighboring Brazil, which often also source their arms through the country. Paraguay is further a source of much of the continent’s marijuana production, and Ciudad del Este, which borders neighboring Brazil and Argentina, serves as an important regional hub for the Islamic terrorist organization Hezbollah. The country is also beset by endemic corruption and a small if difficult to eliminate homegrown terrorist organization. Despite its challenges, however, the Pena government, in coordination with the U.S., Brazil, Taiwan, and Paraguay’s other international partners, has made important and credible strides to address the nation’s challenges.

I promised a Myanmar update on Friday but I accidentally lied. I forgot it was my birthday and instead spent the day collecting orders from the Asia Bookroom and eating potato scallops with my granddad. A day off ahead of a very busy week may have been a wise move. I’m nervous about the South China Sea, where a meeting between diplomats from Beijing and Manila may not hold for long at all. I’m also very curious about what’s happening between the Myanmar junta and China. In Indonesia, new tariffs may well cause a headache for the government and I never know what’s going on in Malaysia but I try my hardest.

We\\'re not going to pull out and we\\'re not going to be intimidated,” PGC spokesperson Jay Tarriela told reporters on Saturday. The Inquirer later reported that similar vessels were seen intercepting two PGC vessels on Sunday near the Second Thomas Shoal. “Philippines Coast Guard BRP Cabra and BRP Cape Engano now passing, 14 nautical miles (nm) east of Second Thomas Shoal. They have been intercepted by China Coast Guard 5203 and at least six China maritime militia vessels, now closely shadowing,” Ray Powell posted, [as reported by the Inquirer]( PGC has not confirmed the report. The timing here is intriguing. Assuming eventual confirmation of Sunday’s breaking news, these two incidents sandwich an enormous meeting last week between China and the Philippines in Manila. That meeting came in the shadow of the mid-June clash in which one Filipino lost a finger and sparked a flurry of headlines about the US defence treaty. Both sides “affirmed their commitment to de-escalate tensions without prejudice to their respective positions. There was substantial progress on developing measures to manage the situation at sea, but significant differences remain,” the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said in a statement, [as per the AP]( Now what? #### 🇲🇲 Second junta boss heads to China Vice-Senior General Soe Win, the second-in-command in Myanmar’s military junta, touched down in Shandong province, China, over the weekend, [AFP reports here]( He’s attending the Green Development Forum hosted by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, as per junta media. It’s interesting timing. Soe Win’s boss, Min Aung Hlaing, hasn’t popped over since seizing control of the country and it comes right as the China-brokered peace deal in northern Shan state collapsed. China-Myanmar junta relations are a tricky, tricky business so I’ll be watching enthusiastically for analysis in the coming days. #### 🇹🇭 Red light for cannabis in Thailand As long threatened by the Srettha Thaivisin government, cannabis is back on the naughty list. Cannabis and hemp will both be reclassified as narcotics from Jan. 1 following a committee meeting led by Dr Surachoke Tangwiwat, deputy permanent secretary at the Ministry of Public Health, [Bangkok Post reports]( Not unexpected by any means but certainly very puzzling on how this will work in practice. Cannabis has already become a major industry in Thailand and those stakeholders won’t be going down easily. Demonstrations planned for this week will see pro-cannabis advocates make their case for keeping the drug accessible. Former health minister Anutin Charnvirakul, whose CV includes changing the laws that allowed cannabis to prosper like this, [wants answers]( He says the same committee that wants recriminalisation voted to decriminalise it during his era, so what gives? “We\\'ve relaxed the regulations to allow people to make use of cannabis. What will happen to people who grow cannabis? Will they face legal action? What about some 8,000 cannabis-related offenders who were freed in June 2022?” #### 🇮🇩 Business bites back in Indonesia Massive new tariffs flagged by Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan last week are not the answer says Arsjad Rasjid, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, [told Nikkei Asia]( The Ministry is eyeing up to 200% tariffs on ‘imported footwear, clothing, textiles, cosmetics and ceramics,’ Nikkei notes, in an effort to safeguard local industries from cheap imports manufactured elsewhere in Asia. “The [minister\\'s] spirit is good for the industry, ... but [it is] not the solution,” Arsjad said. “The key is governance … so that there is a fair competition.” Business might not be happy, but the Ministry is tossing up extending the tariff program further. Electronics are on the agenda, [Bloomberg reports]( adding that the Minister flagged introducing the tariff on products from the European Union and Australia also. “We are not targeting a certain country,” Zulkifli said on Friday after days of headlines pointing to Chinese imports. #### 🇲🇾 The Najib spectre haunts, but not from home Najib Razak is not going anywhere, the Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled last Wednesday. His legal team argued the former prime minister should serve his monumental corruption sentences at home but the court found that a no-go and declined a full hearing, [Al Jazeera reports]( Najib will appeal. “The court said there is no legal duty but in terms of ethics, the government should have answered,” his lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told media. With poor showings for Najib’s UMNO in recent by-elections, the ruling appears to have hit the party hard, [as Malaysiakini reports here]( UMNO supreme council member Puad Zarkashi vented over the weekend that until Najib is freed, the party will leak Malay support: “For UMNO members and Najib\\'s sympathisers, as long as he is denied his rights and fair trial, they will hesitate. Malay support will not recover.” I love an introspective time for UMNO, so I’m looking forward to see what this train of thought produces. #### 🇲🇾 The Tun inches on a ton It would be remiss of me not to note another big birthday this July. Former prime minister and the eldest of regional elder statesmen Mahathir Mohamad will turn 99 on Wednesday. [He sat down with Sinar Daily]( at the end of June to chat all things politics, raising his concerns about the current leadership and the economic stresses of everyday Malaysians. American readers may want to skip that one, he’s in very lucid form. ## Interesting reads [Indonesian band takes stand for Taiwan’s migrant workers]( (Al Jazeera) _Originally from the town of Indramayu in West Java, Rudi struggled to find work in his home country. “It’s hard to find a job in Indonesia, almost impossible,” he told Al Jazeera. “I didn’t have any permanent job. I did everything I could.”_ _Rudi moved to Taiwan in 2015 to operate heavy machinery in a factory. Like many of the island’s 768,000-odd migrant workers, he was looking for employment and the chance to build a better life._ _But the reality is often more complicated. While migrant workers earn more in Taiwan, many find themselves exploited, trapped in debt or facing physical and sexual abuse.

It isn’t the first time Petro has gone on the offensive against journalists [  ] or the FLIP. But the catalyst for this most recent fight between the most powerful man in Colombia and one of the few organizations that protect journalists in a country that ranks in the bottom third of press freedoms worldwide [  ] was a series of articles about the alleged corruption of ex-cabinet members in his administration. On Twitter, Gustavo Petro called the articles \"Mossad journalism\", suggesting that the journalist who wrote them, María Jimena Duzán, was involved in a coordinated disinformation campaign to damage his government. He also called on the FLIP to persecute journalists who publish what he has often called “fake news”— a term popularized by former U.S. president Donald Trump. On June 26, FLIP issued a statement [  ] in which it expressed its concern about the accusations that Petro had issued against media and journalists who investigate alleged acts of corruption by people close to his government team. \"We reiterate our concern for the strategy maintained by President Gustavo Petro to discredit and stigmatize the work of journalists and media outlets that oversee the management of his government, thus ignoring his obligation as president to promote an optimal climate for the exercise of journalistic work,\" said the Foundation. “Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are fundamental rights that must be guaranteed by the State and exercised with responsibility,” continued the FLIP in their statement Being a local beat journo in Colombia is deadly work Colombia is among the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, especially local journalists who investigate the nexus between criminal groups and politicians in areas plagued by conflict. Five such journalists have been murdered in Colombia in the last 19 months over their anti-corruption work. Two other journalists\\' murders are also under investigation for less clear circumstances. But instead of retreating from his comments after the statement by the FLIP, Petro instead doubled down with new public attacks. From there, thousands of messages containing disinformation or stigmatizing the FLIP were sent by the president’s followers, digital influencers with wide resonance, members of Congress of his party (Historical Pact), and appointed government officials— some of which Petro amplified on his Twitter account [  ]. The false claims included accusations that the FLIP protects only wealthy right-wing journalists (they don’t), that they didn’t defend journalists who exposed corruption or malfeasance in previous right-wing administrations (they did) and that they don’t offer services or amplify independent or local journalists, especially in conflict areas (that is, in fact, their principal activity). In the following days, he suggested [  ] that because one of the founders of the FLIP, who has not formed part of the organization for more than 20 years, has been accused of ties to paramilitary organizations, the FLIP must be inherently corrupt. He also repeatedly referred to journalists pushing back against the false accusations as “neo-nazis”. He also, falsely, claimed that the organization had never released a statement condemning the deaths of 158 journalists in Gaza. They have [  ]. As journalists across the political spectrum began to unify around the FLIP [  ], he doubled down on attacks rather than backtracking. During a 5-day tweetstorm on the subject, he publicly attacked a freelance journalist [  ] who writes for center-left newspaper El Espectador who was trying to clear up the confusion, and calling the false accusations dangerous. The accusations led to some of the president\\'s millions of followers harassing, and at times even threatening, journalists who have spoken out about press freedoms in the country. The fight goes international “I think this popular outrage comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about what the FLIP does,” said Adriaan Alsema, editor and founder of Colombia Reports [  ], the oldest English-language online news website in the country. “Every day the organization is helping journalists in conflict areas apply for protection from the state, issuing flak jackets and helmets to those covering riots and civil disturbances, providing legal resources to journalists being accused of libel by corrupt politicians” and other actions that aid journalists facing physical or legal threats, including money for hotels and travel when local journalists face immediate threat are forced to flee as a result of their work, he told PWS. As the public battle escalated, institutions both within and outside of the country issued statements expressing concern over Petro’s actions. The Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation (PARES), a Colombian NGO that advocates for peace implementation in Colombia released a communique [  ] reminding the president that “the FLIP has a long history of protecting journalists no matter who the president may be”. Reporters Without Borders, (RSF by their French acronym), an international NGO that tracks press freedom worldwide, said [  ]the organization “categorically rejects” statements by Petro, and “any harassment” towards those journalists who exercise that right. The Committee to Protect Journalists, (CPJ), also issued a statement [  ] expressing concern that “Petro’s stigmatizing discourse against the press and journalists encourages other authorities and his supporters to do the same, putting investigations on issues of public interest at risk.” Petro did not immediately respond to the statements.

Press Freedom in Colombia Colombia has long struggled with press freedom, not just due to physical threats from criminal groups, but also due to institutional oppression by the Colombian state. According to RSF, the country ranks 119th of 180 countries in the world. [  ] In addition to physical repression, which has included wiretapping of journalists [  ] by intelligence and physical attacks [  ] under previous administrations, RSF also identifies the hegemonic control of large corporate media owned by right-wing donors as a problem for the freedom of expression. Some of that media landscape, particularly columnists for large right-wing propaganda outlets [  ], have released thinly sourced opinion pieces making wild accusations against the Petro administration. “There is good journalism and bad journalism, as in all professions, said Ana Cristina Restrepo, president of the board at the FLIP. “But freedom of the press is a mark of democracy.” Laura Bonilla, deputy director of PARES said that the mission of FLIP \"is not to control the press, nor its quality, but to defend freedom of the press\". \"It is true that Colombia has had a media that has been very complacent with power, but at the same time brave, honest and ethical journalists\", have risked their lives to expose wrongdoings by the state. Press freedom under Petro has improved in comparison to the previous administration of Iván Duque, who was criticized for widespread police repression of journalists during a national strike in 2021 (a phenomenon well documented by the FLIP [  ] at the time) as well as spying on journalists critical of his administration. When Duque left office, the country was ranked 134th in the world, a position that Petro has improved, in contrast with previous governments in Colombia, simply by not physically attacking journalists. But the risk is that stigmatization and demonization of the entire journalistic profession by the National Government sends a signal of impunity for actions against journalists as individuals, and reverses those gains. Petro promised in the campaign to end such practices. He currently faces an opportunity to do so. Or he could adopt the strategy of strongmen in Latin America like Bukele and Ortega, who intimidate critical voices and, at times into exile. [  ] The choice is his. The Big Headlines in LATAM Panama announced the closure of three of the main encampments that receive and provide humanitarian assistance to migrants who have entered the country via the Darien Gap. The decision will endanger the lives of migrants in what is already the most dangerous land corridor for migration in the world. The move also occurs amidst U.S. pressure to cut down on migration throughout the Americas, and a new joint anti-migrant operation between U.S. and Panamanian officials.

Spanish Word of the Week periodismo amarillista - Yellow journalism “Yellow journalism”, in English sounds a bit antiquated. It came originally from the U.K. to refer to newspapers that relied on gross exaggerations, insinuation or outright propaganda to drive newspaper sales. It refers, in short, to all the worst ethical presses of a free press. But the term is still very much alive in common usage among Spanish speakers. And the phenomenon of yellow journalism is alive and well all over the world. Unfortunately, some journalists are more interested in driving a pre-conceived narrative than uncovering the truth. And even more sadly, some aren’t above outright lying. But despite the bad actors, no matter where you go, journalism (and the right to criticize power) remain fundamental for a free society. And a lot of journalists all over the world risk their lives every day to do exactly that. Please support them if you can! They deserve it.
