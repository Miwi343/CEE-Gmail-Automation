Officers arrested Chiquinho and Domingos Brazão — two brothers who once served on Rio’s City Council — on accusations that they ordered Franco’s murder to silence her battles against corruption. Former Rio police chief Rivaldo Barbosa was also detained yesterday.\r\n",

      "“We have found a person of my total trust, honorable, who is going to fulfill this procedure,” Machado said Friday. “This was a decision that arose from within the discussion of the unitary forces and that gives us all confidence.” Analysts on Friday celebrated the unity of the often fractious Venezuelan opposition. \r\n",
      "Yoris was a surprise replacement for Machado, named just ahead of today’s deadline for candidate registration. But today Yoris denounced that the National Electoral Council (CNE) has prevented her from registering, a move she said trampled on her civic rights. \r\n",
      "On Friday Machado noted that previous to the announcement of Yoris’ candidacy, she had not been subject to a ban on running for office. Yoris was part of the group of civil society personalities that formed part of the opposition’s National Primary Commission and has an extensive academic resume.\r\n",
      "Yoris emphasized in a press conference today that she is not a substitute candidate, though she is widely portrayed as a proxy for Machado. Previous to Friday, many analysts said a proxy candidate was the best way for Machado to access the ballot. In Venezuela political parties can substitute candidates up to 10 days before the election, if electoral authorities approve.\r\n",
      "If she wins the election in July, Yoris said her first act as president will be to release Venezuela's political prisoners, who number at least 250 and include civilians and members of the military.\r\n",

      "Venezuela’s ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) formally nominated President Nicolás Maduro as its candidate in the upcoming July presidential elections. He has been widely expected to run for reelection. \r\n",
      "If Maduro wins, it would be his second reelection, though the 2018 vote that granted him a second six-year term was widely considered fraudulent, notes France 24 [ https://substack.com/redirect/04a54662-2778-4a9c-9367-11929af755d8?j=eyJ1IjoiMzFmdXh4In0.L520X0qdNbvIdiyCXDPuD09Laf4PkKgM7ejvjLgFci4 ].\r\n",

It can risk a deep fracture in its coalition. Or it can name a replacement candidate. So far, it is likely to run a “plan B” candidate in the unfair process, but the challenge will be moving forward with this plan while maintaining a united front.”\r\n",
      "A possible strategy would be for Machado to name a trusted replacement, who if successful could appoint her vicepresident and resign. Though difficult, “this strategy would allow Machado to cement her image as not just a candidate, but as the leader of a broad and diverse majority of Venezuelans working to restore the country’s democratic institutions,” according to Ramsey.\r\n",
